User selects up to N friends that they trust
User picks a threshold M
User selects a minimum delay period for the recovery process
User places a refundable configuration deposit, making sure that previous data/accounts are cleaned up
Step 2: Lose access to your account
We don’t recommend performing this step, but just in case you do lose access, continue to step 3
Step 3: Initiate recovery process
User creates a new account
User funds this new account with enough funds to pay the recovery deposit and pay for transaction fees
User calls the Recovery pallet by declaring the account that is lost, and the new account with the deposit
User contacts friends to vouch for your recovery attempt
At least M of N friends need to approve
Wait for the delay period to pass
Once these steps are completed, you are now able to make calls with your lost account.
The recovery pallet gives you access to all other pallets. This is so that each pallet that’s configured on the blockchain runtime you’re using does not need further configuration if the Recovery pallet is implemented on-chain.
Step 4: Clean up your old account
Close the recovery process, which refunds the deposit
Remove recovery configuration, which refunds the other deposit
Call other pallets through the Recovery pallets, such as unbonding, removing Identity information
Finally, transfer all your funds from the lost account to your new account

There are a few safeguards we put in place to prevent malicious account recovery attempts.
First, the minimum threshold of friends needs to approve the recovery initiation. Security experts often say that the largest attack vector is social engineering attacks, and this case is no different. A malicious user may compromise another social media account or create a similar looking account to trick your friends into believing this is you. Hopefully, your friends will notice the attempt and block it. But what happens if this part of the attack is successful?
If enough friends approve the recovery process initiation, the attacker still must wait the delay period to gain access to your funds. However, if you check your account just once during this delay period, you can cancel the recovery process and get the deposit the attacker made. So in a sense, it’s a honeypot for malicious users if you catch them in time.
After you notice a malicious recovery attempt, it is recommended you change the set of friends and remove those who were easily tricked.

Set a long delay period
The longer the delay period is, the less often you must check your account, and the more likely it is you will catch a malicious recovery attempt. For accounts with most of your holdings, it is recommended to have very long delay periods of 6 months to 1 year, just in case.
Set a high threshold count
If possible, you should set a high threshold count in order to initiate the recovery process. A threshold of 2-out-of-3 is probably too low for accounts you value highly. Something more like 7-out-of-10 may be more wise.
Pick your friends wisely, and update them regularly
Make sure that the group of friends you choose are well spread out among your social circle. It is not recommended to choose friends only from the same company you work with, or any group that could easily collude to initiate the recovery process. Also, as you progress through life, friends may change, so we recommend you also update your friends list on-chain as regularly as possible.

They act as proxies allowing for separation of concerns with respect to regular user-controlled wallets holding private keys, which, however, may still be subject to transaction submission fees or permissioning schemes depending on the base layer protocol. These account management models can be implemented directly as features within smart contract vaults or through a collection of authorized modules. They can permit multi-signature schemes and security and recoverability rules, such as security periods, thresholds requirements, and emergency modes. In delegated account recovery models, the wallet owner defines a set of recovery addresses, the private keys of which can be held in custody across the owner’s devices, by trusted intermediaries, or social connections. Notably, such account recovery models do not require the use of seed phrases or full account custody by a third party. Wallet applications may abstract away features supported by smart contract vaults by deploying the smart contracts internally on behalf of users when creating new accounts. Since smart contracts can hold tokens on behalf of users, schemes can be built that allow tokens to be sent to users even before they create a wallet. Instead, a smart contract is deployed with a mechanism that allows it to be claimed later by the new user via a known trusted attribute (e.g., phone number). Joint or “Treasury” Vaults: Groups of users or organizations can share the ownership and management of an account and the tokens it contains by using a multi-signature or “treasury” smart contract vault that enables trustees to propose token withdrawals and requires a certain number of them to approve each proposal before conducting a withdrawal. Such joint vaults may also implement additional agreed-upon clauses. Protocol Collaterals/Deposit Vaults: Protocols can use smart contract vaults (or deposit contracts) to receive tokens and condition their release. Token collateralization is used to secure individual transactions, such as atomic swaps (see Section 4.1.2.1), through self-enforceable rules. On a wider scale, token collateralization—or staking—is also used to build cryptoeconomic incentives for community-controlled networks, either at the base layer or at the smart contract layer. When staked, tokens can earn yields or provide benefits and privileges within the protocol (see Section 6.1). In proof-of-stake consensus models (see Appendix A), staking serves as the basis for coordinating participants and supporting blockchain network operations (e.g., rewards for participants staking tokens). Certain staking models involve a period during which tokens are locked up (i.e., they cannot be transferred) and subject to penalties, acting as programmable security deposits. On-chain collaterals are also used to enable financial instruments (see Section 6.2), such as for lending and borrowing. The rules that condition the release of smart contract collateral funds can be based on internal blockchain data or external data sources (see Section 5.4). Collateralized token owners can build proofs based on the collateral to authenticate with third parties (see Section 6.4).",,,,

Smart contract vaults are also interchangeably called deposit, escrow, multisignature contracts, or simply smart contracts. Note that, as discussed in Section 2.1.3, to hold tokens in custody, smart contracts must implement the necessary logic for handling the corresponding types of tokens. Smart contracts can record deposits as either an “internal” non-transferable balance or as new units of a separate token (or wrapper) that represent transferable withdrawal rights (i.e., “tokenized” collateral). Since there may be regulatory implications for users, protocols may let users opt in on whether to allow transfers of the withdrawal rights or not. A proxy smart contract may also allow adding, verifiably suspending, or conditioning the ability to transfer collateral withdrawal right tokens or giving a third party the ability to place a hold without modifying the issuing protocols. Key collateralization schemes, particularly useful for securing individual transactions, include cryptographic timelocks to place time conditions and hashlocks to require the knowledge of a secret. A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a smart contract that implements these two techniques, allowing for deposit contracts to be built with vesting periods and conditioned refunds.",,,,

Recovery wallet compromise: An attacker who successfully compromises a threshold of signing keys from the recovery wallet (despite the stringent procedural limitations for their accessibility) can (while the wallet owner is unaware) easily claim any funds that are ‘recovered’, after the broadcast of P2RW transactions. The optimal strategy for an attacker here would be to wait for an attempt to recover funds (forced through some other attack or loss scenario) and to claim those funds. In response, once notified of the breach, the wallet owner understands that they should keep the remaining P2RW transactions private and only access funds through the time-locked spending path of the AVTs. The loss incurred here will be limited by the rate that P2RW transactions are broadcast. 2. Recovery wallet and P2RW compromise: An attacker who successfully compromises a sufficient threshold of private keys from the recovery wallet and gains access to the full set of P2RW transactions will have knowledge of the distribution of funds across AVTs. Since they cannot force the wallet owner to attempt to un-vault funds, their best strategy would be to wait for the AVT with a large portion of funds to be broadcast, and to claim it by broadcasting the associated P2RW transaction with a theft transaction. If the breach is detected, the wallet owner could choose to thwart further thefts by keeping the remaining AVTs private and freezing those funds. Alternatively, the wallet owner could attempt to race the attacker by creating transactions with higher priority (or by collaborating directly with a miner). The theft here is limited by the rate of broadcast of AVTs but the loss could be total (if the wallet owner decides to freeze all funds). 3. Recovery wallet and AVT compromise: In the case where an attacker successfully compromises a sufficient threshold of keys from the recovery wallet and the set of AVTs, the strategy space for attack is complicated and depends upon the response of the wallet owner. Assuming that the wallet owner is unaware of the compromise of the recovery wallet but is notified by the watchtower that the set of AVTs has been broadcast by an attacker, the wallet owner would attempt 14/22 to recover funds by broadcasting the P2RW transactions (since allowing the time-locks to expire would reduce the security of all funds to that of the active wallet, which is supposed to be less well secured than the recovery wallet). This would enable the attacker to broadcast theft transactions and attempt to claim all funds. If instead the wallet owner detects or suspects that the recovery wallet is compromised too, they may thwart the attack by keeping the P2RW transactions private and allowing the time-locks to expire, perhaps re-vaulting funds with a new set of recovery devices. This demonstrates a motivation for limiting the rate of release of P2RW transactions when a compromise is suspected. 4. Recovery wallet, AVT and P2RW compromise: An attacker in this case can trigger total recovery of funds by broadcasting all AVTs and P2RW transactions, claiming those funds with theft transactions which evade the time-locked spending paths. A vigilant and swift wallet owner may be able to salvage some of the funds if they can generate transactions that recover funds with higher priority than the attackers’ theft transactions. The amount lost or stolen depends on the ability of the wallet owner to have their transactions mined before the attacker’s theft transactions and ranges from small loss (limited by the amount stolen before the intrusion detection) to total loss of funds. This demonstrates why the storage of covenant transactions should be totally independent from the recovery wallet. Independent storage of AVTs from P2RW transactions also improves resistance to this failure mode. 5. Recovery wallet and watchtower compromise: One might consider ways in which the attacker could convince the wallet owner that the AVTs or active wallet were compromised, in order to trigger a recovery process (broadcasting the P2RW transactions), enabling the attacker to claim all funds with theft transactions. This could be done by maliciously triggering the watchtower with a fake un-vault transaction (a watchtower should be designed to validate un-vault transactions to avoid this). Perhaps there are other ways to attack the watchtower, such as an eclipse attack that convinces the watchtower that an un-vault transaction has occurred (a watchtower should consist of at least two separate nodes with diverse connections). Perhaps a m-i-t-m attack can compromise the communications channel between the watchtower and the wallet owner (a watchtower should have multiple out-of-band communication channels with the wallet owner). If the watchtower is not secure, then this is the worst case scenario and a total loss of funds could occur. Provided at least one of the watchtower machines remains secure and the intrusion is detected, the wallet owner would have to race the attacker by broadcasting recovery transactions with higher priority than the theft transactions in an attempt to salvage some of the losses. Other catastrophic failure modes which don’t involve a compromised recovery wallet include; 6. Active wallet and AVT and watchtower compromise: Consider an attacker who successfully compromises the active wallet signing keys and gains access to the AVTs and manages to stop the watchtower from notifying the wallet owner of attempts to un-vault funds. The attacker can freely broadcast the AVTs, wait for the time-locks to expire, and spend funds using the active wallet’s signing keys. This catastrophic failure could incur a loss of all funds. 7. Failed key deletion/ ephemeral vault key compromise: An attacker who successfully compromises a sufficient threshold of signing keys and addresses from the vault wallet (either during their lifecycle or by recovery after deletion) could revoke the covenants which control funds and by-pass their constraints. A set of theft transactions could be created which spend all funds that were thought to be controlled by AVTs. The wallet owner may be alerted of this provided the watchtower can detect attempts to spend from vault deposit outputs. Then the wallet owner would be in a race to have the AVTs mined before the theft transactions. 8. Failed Key deletion/ ephemeral vault key and watchtower compromise: An attacker who successfully compromises a sufficient threshold of signing keys and addresses from the vault wallet (either during their lifecycle or by recovery after deletion) and gains control of the watchtower can broadcast arbitrary theft transactions without the wallet owner being notified. This scenario is the worst case, resulting in a total loss of vaulted funds.",,,,

Low mental overhead: as much as possible, it should not require users to learn strange new habits or exert mental effort to always remember to follow certain patterns of behavior.

",https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html,Social Recovery wallet,,"Social recovery is better
This gets us to my preferred method for securing a wallet: social recovery. A social recovery system works as follows:
There is a single ""signing key"" that can be used to approve transactions
There is a set of at least 3 (or a much higher number) of ""guardians"", of which a majority can cooperate to change the signing key of the account.
The signing key has the ability to add or remove guardians, though only after a delay (often 1-3 days).


Under all normal circumstances, the user can simply use their social recovery wallet like a regular wallet, signing messages with their signing key so that each transaction signed can fly off with a single confirmation click much like it would in a ""traditional"" wallet like Metamask.
If a user loses their signing key, that is when the social recovery functionality would kick in. The user can simply reach out to their guardians and ask them to sign a special transaction to change the signing pubkey registered in the wallet contract to a new one. This is easy: they can simply go to a webpage such as security.loopring.io, sign in, see a recovery request and sign it. About as easy for each guardian as making a Uniswap trade.
There are many possible choices for whom to select as a guardian. The three most common choices are:
Other devices (or paper mnemonics) owned by the wallet holder themselves
Friends and family members
Institutions, which would sign a recovery message if they get a confirmation of your phone number or email or perhaps in high value cases verify you personally by video call
Guardians are easy to add: you can add a guardian simply by typing in their ENS name or ETH address, though most social recovery wallets will require the guardian to sign a transaction in the recovery webpage to agree to be added. In any sanely designed social recovery wallet, the guardian does NOT need to download and use the same wallet; they can simply use their existing Ethereum wallet, whichever type of wallet it is. Given the high convenience of adding guardians, if you are lucky enough that your social circles are already made up of Ethereum users, I personally favor high guardian counts (ideally 7+) for increased security. If you already have a wallet, there is no ongoing mental effort required to be a guardian: any recovery operations that you do would be done through your existing wallet. If you not know many other active Ethereum users, then a smaller number of guardians that you trust to be technically competent is best.

This can be accomplished in two ways. First, instead of the guardians' addresses being stored directly on chain, a hash of the list of addresses can be stored on chain, and the wallet owner would only need to publish the full list at recovery time. Second, each guardian can be asked to deterministically generate a new single-purpose address that they would use just for that particular recovery; they would not need to actually send any transactions with that address unless a recovery is actually required. To complement these technical protections, it's recommended to choose a diverse collection of guardians from different social circles (including ideally one institutional guardian); these recommendations together would make it extremely difficult for the guardians to be attacked simultaneously or collude.

Blockchain The article Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System [25] by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 introduced the concept of the blockchain. The blockchain is a chain structure composed of sequential links of blocks. The blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, nontampering, and transparency. Blockchain technology is consistently evolving and being applied in various fields of activity [26]. In 2014, Ethereum was proposed [27]. Ethereum allows people to deploy decentralized applications onto it based on smart contracts. Smart contracts have greatly enriched the application of blockchains. 2.2. Smart Contracts Smart contracts were first proposed by Nick Szabo in 1995 [28]. After the emergence of Ethereum in 2014, smart contracts began to be used on a large scale. A smart contract can be defined as an agreement within the blockchain between two people. The most important part of this agreement is that it is self-executing, secure, and does not require any third-party involvement such as lawyers or banks. It also eliminates counterparty risk by allowing users to check their balances at any point in time and makes sure no one has changed their balances without mutual consent. 2.3. NFT Fungible tokens (FT) are divisible and non-unique. For instance, fiat currencies such as the dollar are fungible: A USD 1 bill in New York City has the same value as a USD 1 bill in Miami. A fungible token can also be a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin: BTC 1 is worth BTC 1, no matter where it is issued. The most representative fungible token protocol is ERC20 [29]. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Since storing data on the chain is very expensive, the metadata of NFTs are often stored on decentralized storage systems such as an Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) [30].",,,,

The IdP knows both users’ identities and wallet accounts in all existing systems, which poses a threat to privacy. The scheme divides IdPs into supervisors and the KYC provider. Supervisors are responsible for tracing the identities of suspicious accounts, and the KYC provider is responsible for checking the identity of users. The association of identity and wallet accounts is done by the user. Supervisors can investigate the identities corresponding to suspicious wallet accounts through the information held by the KYC provider and VASPs. Therefore, for normal users, their privacy is preserved because no one but themselves knows the association between their wallet account and their real-world identity.",,,,

Due to the collision resistance of the hash function, it is difficult to find two wallet accounts that can generate the same hash value, so the Merkle membership proofs of wallet accounts are difficult to forge or fraudulently use. In addition, if the private key of the manager account is stolen, the attacker needs to initiate a transaction to update the MerkleRoot to authorize his wallet account. When users notice suspicious transactions, they can contact the KYC provider to call the contract to freeze their identity and designate a new manager account. Therefore, the risk of a user’s identity being maliciously linked to other wallet accounts is low. In existing schemes, identities and wallets are generally statically bound, for example, blockchain-based DID schemes use wallet accounts as DIDs, whereas in SBT schemes, identities are bound to wallet accounts by issuing NFTs. Once the wallet’s private key is lost, the identity will also be lost. In the scheme, the KYCManager contract owns each KYCNFT so the KYCNFT is non-transferable and will not be lost. The wallet account and the KYCNFT are dynamically bound so the identity is still available even if the private key of the wallet account is lost. If a user loses the private key of the manager account, he can contact the KYC provider to set up a new manager account. If the private key of an authorized wallet account is leaked or lost, the user can update MerkleRoot to revoke the authorization of this wallet account.",,,,

Identity Based System (IBS) stores the identity (idU ) of users within the system. IBS could be assumed as any identity-based system such as the Aadhaar system in India or SSIN number in the USA. It will help entities to confirm and verify users identities after demise. IBS has the functionality of authentication service. Any user(u,idU ) can authenticate himself uniquely and correctly using this service.",,,,

Death is purely unpredictable. It does not depend on any physical parameters and real-world constraints. The existing models of asset management use the following mechanisms to confirm the death [10,30,35,37]: i) voting: In this method, all nominees vote to confirm the death. However, if any nominee denies voting, the asset cannot be recovered; ii) weighted voting: It allows confirmation of death by a threshold number of nominees, each having different weights. Although, if some nominees with higher weights deny voting, the threshold cannot be achieved; iii) notary: is a legal person who confirms the user’s death and also stores the secret key which will be used later by the nominee to learn about the asset. However, if the notary denies participating in the protocol then the nominee can never retrieve this secret key; iv) inactivity period: In this method, the user’s logged-in status is collected from different social media accounts (for example, E-mail, Facebook), and if a user has not logged-in since a pre-defined time, the death is confirmed. However, due to the privacy policy, many websites may not share login details with other organizations. Further, if a user is alive and forgot to update his liveliness status through account login, all his secrets would be revealed to the nominee; and v)secret sharing: In this method, the multiple nominees hold the shares of the key. After the user’s death, nominees submit their shares and recover the key. This method does not validate death correctly as all the nominees may collude with each other. The incorrect execution of death confirmation may produce adverse effects on the model. Therefore, we need a trusted entity who will confirm the user’s demise correctly; otherwise, the complete model will fail",,,,

Recently, few asset inheritance models have been proposed using Blockchain such as PassOn [30], DigiPulse [10], SafeHaven [35], TrustVerse [37]. In DigiPulse, the user can store sensitive data at the DigiPulse portal in the encrypted form and hash of files on the blockchain to maintain integrity. Thereafter, the encryption key can be distributed among nominees using any secret sharing schemes. PassOn converts various assets in the form of tokens and stores them on the blockchain. The tokens can be transferred to the family member in case of the death of the user. SafeHaven uses a secret sharing scheme to distribute cryptocurrency secret keys among nominees. The original key can be reproduced when each nominee will submit their share, including the share of a trusted party known as Trusted Alliance Network (TAN). TrustVerse is an estate planning and asset management system which allows a user and its family members to create a smart contract using blockchain for an asset. The smart contract will be executed when a threshold number of family members will confirm the death. However, all these have a poor technical description and have many existing challenges, such as being applicable only for type 3 category assets, the possibility of recreation of the incorrect key by a nominee, or weak method of death confirmation",,,,

Asset privacy - , guarantees that no third party, including NDP, can reveal anything from the data stored at NDP portal. 2. Non-repudiation - Non-repudiation ensures that during the execution of protocol Π2, organization cannot deny from holding of the asset when nominee request for it (see Sect. 2.4). In order to prove this, consider a nominee having input idN . During the execution of the protocol Π2, the nominee sends (DCU , RCU n ,idU , nonce, accU ) to organization for claiming the asset. If the organization is honest then he will transfer the asset to the nominee after performing necessary verification as shown in the steps ix-xi. If the organization is malicious then there are two cases: if organization denies the existence of user’s account then in this case nominee can provide (MU O , σ(U) O ) which ensures that user’s account does exist in that organization; if organization denies transferring the asset then in this case the parties need to resolve the dispute with the help of trusted legal third party. 3. Identifiability - The protocol Π is said to achieve identifiability if it fulfills the following conditions (as defined in Sect. 2.4): i) the user’s identity is not known to the organization before death; and ii) After death, an organization knows the identity of the user. Note that the protocol Π1 ensures the first condition while Π2 ensures the second condition. The user U stores id  U = H(idU ||nonceO ) to the organization O during the execution of protocol Π1 in step 2. In order to prove the first property, we consider the following cases: 4. Key inheritance privacy - The asset key inheritance privacy guarantees that the key is revealed to the designated nominee only in the protocol. During the execution of protocol Π2, nominee sends (idU ,idN , nameN ,idN ,r pU N )to obtain (DCU , RCU N ). Using this, nominee can get the first partial key kO from CAP. He can recover the list of nominee nlist from Ainfo designated against the asset Acert . Now if n does not belong to the nlist then he can not decrypt cNi because of the CLE security definition. Thus, protocol Π2 guarantees the key inheritance privacy property. 5. User’s privacy - The DAI protocol Π guarantees user’s privacy if the data stored at NDP portal does not reveal the identity of the user. The user U stores asset inheritance data using idU . If both NDP and IBS do not collude then the protocol Π achieves the user’s privacy due to the pre-image security of the hash function, A will not be able to know the mapping. However, if adversary A corrupts and controls both entities then their input, internal state, and views will be known to A. Since A knows the identity of user’s who have stored DAI data at NDP, therefore, user’s privacy is not guaranteed. 6. Correctness - The protocol Π guarantees the correctness properties if both user and nominee can be identified and verified correctly by the organization before transfer of the asset (as defined in Sect. 2.4). We can prove correctness of both properties using the following cases: Correctness 1—User’s identification: The organization can verify the user correctly before transfer of asset. During the execution of the protocol Π2, nominee submits (DCU , RCU N ,idU , nonceO , accU ). The organization can calculate commitment value as H(idU nonceO ) == id  U which ensure the correctness of user’s identity. An adversary A will not be able to generate a value id∗ u such that id  U == H(id∗ U ||nonceO ) due to the security of hash function. Correctness 2—Nominee verification: The nominee n obtains (idU , Acert, Ainfo, c1) from step iv in the execution of protocol Π2. Using this only designated nominee can retrieve the value of nonceO . Nominee send (DCU , RCU N ,idU , nonceO , accU ) to the organization. The organization can verify (DCU , RCU N from the CAP to ensure the correctness. In the case of adversarial nominee A, he can obtains the value (DCU ,idU , nonceO , accU ) by colluding with other nominee. However, A will not be able to generate RCU N so would not be able to claim for the asset. Robustness A DAI protocol Π is said to be robust if nominee can retrieve the asset or asset information without any loss. The execution of protocol Π1 and Π2 clearly shows that nominee can obtain data from IBS, CAP, and NDP and will able to know DAI. He can communicate with organization to retrieve the asset successfully. However, asset retrieval will not work if any entity such as IBS or NDP refuses holding of data",,,,

All three states have expanded the scope of the rights guaranteed by the provisions of Articles 15–22 GDPR after the death of the data subject. The new regulations aim to strengthen the right to informational self-determination of data subjects,60 which also requires a proactive approach by the future decedent. In French law, in principle, data protection ceases with the death of the subject. In order to prevent this, i.e. in order to prolong its effect after death, the subject must appoint a person authorised to exercise those rights. For these purposes, the future decedent should make a digital will. In other words, he should issue an order, a directive, that can be general (directives générales) or specific (directives particulières), with the respective internet service provider.61 Those directives resemble the concept of advanced directives in case of incapacity.62 In Italy and Spain, the situation is reversed, the data subject must take active action to prevent the data from passing on to its successors. According to the new Italian regulations, if the data subject does not want his heirs, close relatives, or trustees and other persons with a legitimate interest, to exercise the right of data protection after his death, he must explicitly exclude, prohibit or limit it by a written statement that has the characteristics of a power of attorney or agency contract with effects after death (mandatum ad mortem exequendum).63 Such statement must be clear, specific, given freely, and informed.64 It follows that the exclusion of inheritability under the general terms of the contract does not meet the above criteria.

The basic rule stipulates that the internet service provider is not obliged to transfer data to the user’s heirs, unless the user has explicitly agreed to this transfer, which indicates the obligation of active user action.73 Priority is given to user preferences expressed within online tools, i.e. mechanisms that providers themselves make available to their users and through which they can appoint a fiduciary to be given access to data after death or to instruct the provider to delete data, such as Google’s Inactive Account Manager or Facebook’s Legacy Contact. Such directions expressed within online tools even prevail in case of conflict with directions given in wills, trusts, or powers of attorney,74 which indicates that contractual rules prevail over succession law rules. If the user did not give instructions in any of these forms, the general conditions of use of the provider apply, and only if they do not regulate this issue, the rules provided in RUFADAA apply.75 Instructions issued within the online tool of the platform have priority in case of a conflicting disposition in the will or power of attorney, provided that the online tool allows the user to change or revoke such instruction at any time.76 Contrary to European countries that seek to suppress the practice of contractual exclusion of inheritability under standard contractual clauses, in the United States these solutions are viewed favorably.",,,,

SBTs allow a similar, but broader paradigm: community recovery, where the Soul is the intersectional vote of its social network.
Social recovery is a good starting point for security, but has several drawbacks in security and usability. A user curates a set of “guardians'' and gives them the power, by majority, to change the keys of their wallet. Guardians could be a mix of individuals, institutions, or other wallets. The problem is a user must balance the desire for a reasonably high number of guardians against the precaution that guardians be from discrete social circles to avoid collusion. Also, guardians can pass away, relationships sour, or people simply fall out of touch, requiring frequent and attention-taxing updates. While social recovery avoids a single point of failure, successful recovery nonetheless depends on curating and maintaining trusted relationships with a majority of guardians.

However, even more than in the physical economy, the data economy is poorly understood in terms of simple private property. 

Rather than privacy-as-transferable-property-right, a more promising approach is to treat privacy as a programmable, loosely coupled bundle of rights to permission access, alter or profit from information. Under such a paradigm, every SBT—such as an SBT that represents a credential or access to a data store—would ideally also have an implied programmable property right specifying access to the underlying information constituting the SBT: the holders, the agreements between them, the shared property (e.g., data), and obligations to 3rd parties. For example, some issuers would choose to make SBTs wholly public. Some SBTs, such as a passport or health record, would be private in the self-sovereign sense,

However, because PoP protocols seek to represent individual identities—-focused on achieving global uniqueness—rather than social identities mapping relationships and solidarities, PoP protocols are limited to applications that treat all humans the same. Most applications we are interested in—such as staking reputation—are relational and move beyond being a unique human to being a differentiated human.

Moreover, PoP protocols are not immune to sybil attacks. In almost all near-term foreseeable applications, PoP systems are eectively open to Sybil attacks, just at a slightly higher cost. Unless most people on the planet are registered for a PoP service and are participating in a particular validation exercise, an attacker can always recruit disinterested humans who are not yet participating to act as Sybils.

,Argent (cite),,,,"When we launched in 2018 we pioneered social recovery. This lets you recover your wallet using guardians, meaning people or devices you trust, such as a family member or a hardware wallet. 

Guardians are on-chain and made possible by smart contracts. They’re much easier to use and more secure than crypto’s default alternative, seed phrases. 

The downside to social recovery though is that, as it's on-chain, it requires gas. These gas fees have soared due to Ethereum’s rising popularity. It regularly now costs over $100 to recover a wallet.
We’ve therefore built an alternative recovery method. One that’s also highly secure, simple to use, and fully non-custodial. 
It's opt-in for existing users; future users get the option automatically. Both existing and future users can continue to use the older method if they prefer (they'll have to pay the gas fee though). 
",,,,
,Argent (cite),,,,"The new, off-chain recovery method 
The new process combines encryption and Cloud storage. As with recovery with guardians, we built it to protect you even if an attacker somehow seizes control of your device. Argent is the only wallet that offers this level of security. Here's how to use it.
Opt-in to the new approach (before you lose your device)
Existing wallet owners need to enable the new method before they can make a recovery with it. You need to do this before you lose your device. To set it up, you'll either see a prompt when you open Argent or you can tap:
The account switcher icon (top left of home screen)
'Settings'
'Wallet Recovery'
Enable 'Recovery with iCloud / Google Drive' (depending on your device)
To recover your wallet
Download Argent on your new device
Tap 'I have an Argent wallet'
Enter the email address you use for your Argent wallet
Choose 'Recover with iCloud / Google Drive'
Complete two-factor authentication using email and SMS
Wait for the 48 hour security window to complete (this gives you time to cancel the recovery if you want)
Done. 
",,,,
,Argent (cite),,,,"How does the new recovery process work?
The new recovery process uses encryption and cloud storage to ensure that your private keys are protected. It works as follows.
When you enable ‘Recovery with iCloud / Google Drive’, the Argent app generates a random “key-encryption-key” (KEK) that is unique to you. (A KEK is a cryptographic key that is used for the encryption or decryption of other keys).
Your KEK will encrypt your private keys (plural because it applies to both Layer 1 and Layer 2 private keys, even if you only have one type of wallet). 
The encrypted private keys are then stored in your iCloud / Google Drive under your control. Your KEK, meanwhile, is sent to Argent (meaning the company’s infrastructure, not the app). 
This split gives you added protection. If anyone gets access to your iCloud or Google Drive, they can’t decrypt your keys without the KEK that Argent has. And if a malicious actor gets access to our infrastructure, they won’t be able to access your wallet as they won’t have your encrypted private keys.
When you need to recover your wallet, the first thing that will happen is that the Argent app will try to detect your encrypted private keys stored on iCloud / Google Drive. If they’re detected, two-factor authentication is used to verify that you’re the legitimate wallet owner. 
Once this is complete, a 48 hour recovery window starts. This is an additional security layer that gives you time to cancel it if you wish via your Argent security centre (security.argent.xyz). 
After 48 hours, your KEK is securely transferred to your device, which will decrypt and recover your private keys. This gives you back access to your wallet.


",,,,
,Argent (cite),,,,"FAQs
The following section covers some likely questions we imagine people may have.
What happens if I lose access to my cloud storage or delete my encrypted keys?
You’ll always be able to recover your wallet using social recovery with guardians. 
If you haven’t activated your Argent Vault (our existing, Layer 1 wallet) as you only have a L2 zkSync wallet, you’ll need to activate your L1 wallet. This will require a gas fee but will let you recover successfully from there. 
Once you’ve recovered your wallet, you can set up off-chain recovery again. 
Can Apple or Google delete my encrypted private keys?
In the extremely unlikely event that Apple or Google deleted your encrypted private keys, you could always recover your account by using guardians. 
Can Apple or Google take my assets?
No. Accessing your assets requires the encrypted keys stored on the cloud and the KEK that Argent holds. We can always delete your KEK if you suspect someone getting into your cloud storage. 
How can I recover my wallet if iCloud or Google Drive goes down?
You can use social recovery (with gas) or wait until cloud storage goes back online.
Can I use separate email addresses for Argent and cloud storage?
Yes. The email you use for Argent and the cloud storage can be different. 
Can I disable the off-chain recovery method for my wallet?
For existing users, it's opt-in. For future users, it will be set up automatically, but you can just delete the encrypted keys from your cloud storage and disable it that way.
How is it different from Cloud-based recovery using standard Ethereum wallets?
With some standard Ethereum wallets, you have a password that encrypts your seed phrase. It is used to unlock your wallet. If you lose your password and seed phrase, you lose everything.
What happens if I’m a victim of a SIM swap scam - can they recover my wallet?
We’ve made sure to layer up security throughout the recovery process to eliminate a single point of failure like a SIM swap. 
For a hacker to access your wallet, they will need your encrypted private keys stored on either iCloud or Google Drive, details for your two-factor authentication and they would have to wait 48 hours before the KEK that Argent stores gets sent to the Argent app to unlock your wallet. 
If the recovery process for your wallet has been fraudulently triggered, you can cancel the request within 48 hours in our security centre. This is why we have the 48 hour recovery period.",,,,

Contracts are continued under the same conditions by the (joint) heirs, unless specifically stated otherwise in the contract, 18 and property is held or possessed by the (joint) heirs under the same conditions.19 A specific issue arises when the deceased has bequested certain digital assets. This is not always successful when it concerns a digital asset which has been made non-transferrable.

For example, it has been advanced that notaries could discuss the insertion of a ‘socialmedia-executor’ clause into the will, i.e. someone who is responsible for the winding up of these accounts. 70 Alternatively, the client could add a list of accounts and passwords to the will, 71 and the Royal Dutch Association of Civil-law Notaries has supported the development of a ‘digital vault’ where clients can store their data.72 These services of online vaults for passwords are also provided by companies which offer password managers, such as LastPass and 1Password.73 Some years prior, certain Dutch banks also provided the option of a digital vault, but they have since abandoned this practice.74",,,,

And after you log in, and you select the the Family Circle plan, which is our Community Edition, you'll be able to start filling out all the plan details, and who's going to be receiving the inheritable data. And all that data that you type in there, such as phrases to get the wallets such as like on recovering them, right, and accessing exchange accounts. So login credentials, username and password. And it could even be like food recipes or trade secrets, formulas, stuff like stuff like that. But all that data, it gets encrypted utilizing military grade encryption. And for those who want to know what type of encryption that is, that's SHA 256. So after it gets encrypted, it gets fragmented split into multiple different shares. And that's basically this secure share distribution protocol. That's the intellectual property being patented and protected, right. So after it gets split into multiple different shares, what happens is, most of the plant shares get stored on these cold storage devices. And they're pincode protected. So each one is going to have a specific thing encode that you have to give to the beneficiary. And when the owner of the state passes away, all the heirs will meet back up. And they're going to meet with the merge authority. So the merge authority is the person in charge of ensuring that all the assets are distributed properly. Because it's important that everybody understands, we don't have anything to do with distributing whatever is involved with that inheritance plan or Personal Backup plan. Because we don't even know its own, there is just a plan like data that gets fragmented and only those who have those plan shares to combine them back and see that that data so that merge authority is going to be responsible for saying, Okay, this area gets this percentage or that percentage, etc. And after all the plan shares are combined between the heirs and the merge authority. There's still one plan shared message. And that's what makes our protocol so safe. That's the validator share, it's on the blockchain. So the only way you can unlock that validator share is by allowing the deadman switch the deadman’s switch to go on answered and the amount of time depends on the owner of estate. So whenever there's some setting up the plan, they can say if they want it to be a matter of days, weeks, months, etc. And once that time passes, that share unlocks all the heirs are going to have to meet back up with the merge authority. And then whenever they go to combine their plant shares again and they each insert their PIN codes because they're PIN protected. They'll be able to combine it with that validated because there'll be a locked in and then they can see all the inheritable data. So they'll be able to use that data in whichever way possible because some people might not even want to use it for backing up mnemonic phrases, they might just want to use it for backing up a really, really secret message or phrase or, or something, right? Like, it doesn't even have to be crypto-related. That's, that's what's so beautiful about our services. It's, it's powered by crypto technology, the blockchain and you have to use the safe haven tokens. It's 10,000 SHA agreed lifetime plan.",,,,
