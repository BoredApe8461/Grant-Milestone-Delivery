## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of the [Open Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program). You can find the full process [here](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md#pencil-process).  

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
    1. [Fork](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/fork) the [Grant Milestone Delivery](./evaluations/evaluation-template.md) repo with the **same GitHub account, which you used to submit the application!**
    2. In the newly created fork, create a **copy** of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). In other words: In the GitHub web interface, you need to create a new file and copy the content of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) inside the new file. Don't change the template file directly!
    3. Label the file as "project_name_milestone_number.md".
    4. Fill out the [invoice form](https://forms.gle/QvsbeSA3ziuC9k9b9).
    5. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone including a **link to the initial pull request**.
    6. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
2. **Milestone Review:**
    1. Evaluators can issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
    2. Grants Evaluators can approve a pull request to accept the deliverable.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
    1. The Operations Team receives a notification once the delivery was accepted or after two weeks without any feedback after the initial delivery. As soon as feedback is provided by the evaluators, this feedback first needs to be resolved.  
    2. Operations Team makes the payment to the Bitcoin address specified in the initial application.

*Grant application can be amended at any time, necessitating a reevaluation by the Committee.*

## :ballot_box_with_check: External Evaluation [WIP]

As part of the open grant program, we allow everyone to participate in the evaluation process of submitted milestones. In the future, we also plan to incentivize external evaluators.  

### Requirements
* [On-Chain Identity](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/mirror-learn-identity#__docusaurus) on Kusama or Polkadot
* GitHub account
* The evaluation has to be submitted within 10 days after the milestone was delivered. 

### Process
1. [Fork](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/fork) the [Grant Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) repo.
2. In the newly created fork, create a **copy** of the [evaluation-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/evaluations/evaluation-template.md).
3. Label the file as "project_name_milestone_number_your-github-name.md".
4. Fill out the template with the details of your evaluation.
5. Once you have completed the evaluation, click on "create new pull request".
6. Add a comment or review to the pull request, which contains the evaluated milestone delivery. This comment should contain a quick summary of your finding as well as link to the full evaluation.  
7. Milestone evaluations are potentially double-checked by the [W3F Grants Evaluators](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program#team). Successful milestone evaluations are merged. 

*In the future we plan to integrate a reputation system: With each successful milestone evaluation the probability of being double-checked decreases. If you have done enough milestone evaluations, you become part of the Grants Evaluators yourself.*

### Incentivization

*At this point it’s unclear if and how we incentivize external evaluations. Therefore the below is just an initial draft.*

The reward for a successful milestone evaluation will only be paid out to the on-chain identity address. To get part of the rewards the evaluator needs to have done *at least one previous successful milestone evaluation*. The total prize pool will be shared between all successful evaluations.  

``` 
Total prize pool per milestone delivery = estimated duration of milestone x FTE x price multiplicator  
```
