## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of the [Open Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program). You can find the full process [here](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md#pencil-process).  

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
    1. [Fork](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/fork) the [Grant Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) repo with the **same Github account, which you used to submit the application!**
    2. In the newly created fork, create a **copy** of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). In the GitHub web interface, you, therefore, need to create a new file and copy the content of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) inside the new file. Don't change the template file directly!
    3. Label the file as "project_name_milestone_number.md".
    4. Fill out the [invoice form](https://forms.gle/QvsbeSA3ziuC9k9b9).
    5. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone including a **link to the intial PR**.
    6. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
2. **Milestone Review:**
    1. Evaluators can issue comments and request changes on the PR.
    2. Grants Evaluators can approve a pull request to accept the deliverable. 
3. **Milestone Payment:**
    1. Notification is issued to the Operations Team once the delivery was accepted or after 2 weeks without any feedback after the initial delivery. As soon as feedback is provided by the evaluators, this feedback first needs to be resolved.  
    2. Operations Team makes the payment to the BTC address specified in the initial application.

*Grant application can be amended at any time, leading to a need for reevaluation by the Committee.*
