**Additional Information**
Although milestones of the project have been completed, it will continue to be actively developed, I will publish a report stating its status in the next two quarters.

I would like to offer a more detailed infrastructure for testing, but you can test it by using the platform in the easiest way, while everyone can view the public part, I will authorize you when you fill out the form for the project owner dashboard, so you can try this dashboard.

Api key of many platforms such as algolia, aws, thirdweb, coinbase cloud is required to set up a test infrastructure from start to finish, so a partial test report has been published to make things easier.

Main domain currently lists dev branch but after approval I will push a clean main branch and we will start from scratch with new projects, so you can tamper with it as you wish, these changes will not be visible in prod version.
