| 2.  | [Ink! based Smart Contract Standard](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-enterprise-smart-contracts/blob/master/cere01/specification.md) | We are introducing a new smart contract standard which allows assets adaptable for real businesses to be programmatically created, managed, owned, transferred, and traded. It provides a template for establishing a foundation to capture common enterprise utility, and can be easily extended.. This standard is purposefully being built on top of Parityâ€™s ink! Smart contract framework. | Done |
| 2a.  | [Enterprise Derivative Assets](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-enterprise-smart-contracts/blob/master/cere01/specification.md) | Derivative Asset support for the enterprise needs, with attributes such as expiration, limit on transfers, longitudinal unlocking, redemptions, etc | Done |
| 2b.  | [Manual Direct Wallet Transfer](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/private-standalone-network-node/blob/dev/docs/direct_wallet_transfer.md) | Support for most Substrate/Polkadot based wallet applications. Smart Contract transfer function allows for the directly wallet-signed transfer of assets from one application/user address to the other. | Done |
| 2c.  | [Programmatic Asset Transfer](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/private-standalone-network-node/blob/dev/ext20/lib.rs#L100) | Smart Contract transfer function allows for the programmatic/automated transfer of tokens from one application/user via smart contract to the other. | Done |
| 2d.  | [Asset Restrictions](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/private-standalone-network-node/blob/dev/docs/asset_restrictions.md) | Support for the locking of assets by time or by issuer permission, support for expirations and potentially invalidations. | Done |
| 3.  | [Smart Contract Tests](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/private-standalone-network-node/blob/dev/ext20/lib.rs#L196) | The Smart Contract implementation will include unit tests, we will be using the off-chain test environment that ink! provides. | Done |
