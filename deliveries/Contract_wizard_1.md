# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Contract_wizard.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**

The Polkadot Contract Wizard successfully completed its next phase, introducing advanced features to enhance user experience and versatility within the interaction with smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem.

***Achievements***

1) Interaction with Deployed Contracts through UI: Users now have the capability to interact directly with their deployed contracts via the wizard's user interface. This functionality enables users to efficiently manage and execute interactions within the same tool.

2) Interaction with Custom Smart Contracts: The platform now supports interaction with any chosen contract. By providing essential details such as its metadata, network and contract address, the user interface dynamically generates a customized, user-friendly layout for seamless interaction with custom contracts.

3) Shareable Contract Interaction Links: To foster collaboration and simplify contract interaction, we implemented shareable contract interaction links. Users can generate unique links containing all necessary contract information, allowing other users to interact directly without re-uploading metadata or detailed contract specifics.

4) Support for Multiple Chains: The tool's utility has been expanded to allow users to connect to parachains implementing the contracts pallet. A brief list of compatible parachains is provided, and users have the flexibility to connect to unlisted networks by specifying the web socket.
