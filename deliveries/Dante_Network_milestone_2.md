* In this milestone, we finished the basic functions of Danta Protocol, with which users can start their multi-chain dApps being able to be accessed by Polkadot ecosystem and other public chains. The main ablities we completed in this milestone are as follows:
  * Docker for deploy routers
  * Router selection algorithm(We finished this ahead of schedule, which is done in milestone 1)
  * SQoS for ink!
  * Routers process SQoS

* We running a polkadot testnet on AWS, the Dante protocol stack is deployed on it, the Dante protocol address is: `5FVx18cBuQUVS9squHxUUdr2TtBNYBCCXawGM9EWzmXdmwF9`
* And we also deployed Dante protocol stack on `NEARTESTNET`. The address is: `170165c66e33a744726f7f8cd36885cc43aa1e55f88273df5c6aed72e45711e6`

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

**Additional Information**  
* Here is the [Source Code](https://github.com/dantenetwork/protocol-stack-for-ink/tree/feature-sqos/contracts/cross-chain). 

#### **Works until now**  
We really appreciate the help from W3F for this grant. After the delivery of this grant, we have completed the service presentation protocol layer, the basic security items in the SQoS layer, and the belief verification algorithms in the consensus layer.  
With the help of current work of Dante Network, remote invocations can be made between smart contracts deployed on Polkadot Parachains and smart contracts/resources deployed on other ecosystems. The detailed deployment information can be found at [Testnet](https://github.com/dantenetwork/testnet). And we provide [SDKs](https://github.com/dantenetwork/On-Chain-SDK) for easier development of omniverse-dApps.  
#### **Future Work**  
We persist in developing Dante Protocol in an absolutely decentralized way, so there might be still a long way to go.  
  * First, we are building advanced features of Dante Protocol to achieve higher and more efficient security. A commitment verification mechanism based on cryptographic algorithms and a multi-layer gaming model will be built to make a prisoner's dilemma, in which the best strategy for off-chain routers is to do honest things.  
  * Besides, an Omniverse Token Protocol based on Dante Protocol is to be implemented. This kind of token can be accessed from all chains we support without any bridge. So we can help DOT to be Omniverse without any additional work, that is, if someone transfers some DOTs on Polkadot, the same ownership transfer will happen on all connected chains.  
  * In addition, in the future, Dante Protocol will be implemented as a pallet for substrate, and everyone can integrate this pallet into their Parachains.
