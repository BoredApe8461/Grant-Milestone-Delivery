**Additional Information**

**1)** The code of the respective deliverables can be found in the 'Main' branch of each repo.

**2)** All the functionality of **Audit Directory Contract** has been moved to the escrow contract itself for a more seemless and smooth working. This also cuts down redundant deployment costs.

**3)** The functionality of Arbiters Contract ( To serve as the voting contract on the disputes raised over submitted audits ) has been moved to the backend of the application to make it costless for the arbiters to vote while also keeping their virtual signatures private and hence preventing them from being spearfished.

**4)** You can refer to the read-me files of the respective repositories for instructions to set up the project.
