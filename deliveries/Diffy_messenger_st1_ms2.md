* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** 

P2p channels between users are set by usernames using WebRTC. Thу Diffy Chat Substrate pallet is used for exchanging SDP offers. For address discovery of NAT users any public STUN server can be used. All messages between users are encrypted with user’s ed25519 keys and transactions are signed using sr25519 keys (to support Polkadot compatibility). Both keys are tied to usernames so that users do not have to generate ed25519 keys manually. In this milestone we have also added a “contacts” feature.

**Deliverables**
In this milestone our team has executed the following deliverables

- a contacts list feature;
- a web messenger dapp MVP.
