* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/DistributedKeyManagement.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**

This milestone was focused on distributed key management research. Throughout the research process I created a series of blog posts that discuss core concepts like polynomial interpolation and threshold cryptography. The main deliverable is a long form research paper that has been released as an open source document. I also created a short summary of my research for developers looking to build their own implementation.

**Deliverables**


| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | Documentation |https://www.kryptik.app/blog| Same as the third deliverable.| 
| 2.  | Article | https://www.kryptik.app/developer/recovery | A brief overview of distributed key management with a focus on account recovery. Developers are the target audience.| 
| 3. | Formal Investigation |https://www.kryptik.app/blog| A series of blogs created during the research period (shared via Twitter, HN, etc).| 
| 1. | Research Paper |https://github.com/KryptikApp/sword/blob/main/research/SWORD.md| An open source research paper on distributed key management.| 

**Additional Information**

The research process has been a fantastic opportunity to explore and improve wallet security. I have also received a lot of positive feedback from Web3 builders and reserachers. Looking forward to phase two!

Note: In response to milestone feedback, I have modified the original research paper draft. Thanks for the feedback; you have inspired a number of different ideas.
