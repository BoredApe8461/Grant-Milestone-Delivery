- **Gafi Network milestone 1 purpose**
  
  In this milestone, we try to give users including player(end-user) and builder(game creator) some of the features of the Gafi Network that they can try the real hand demo on:
    - Address-mapping of proof-address-mapping
    - Customize  transaction fees services of the Staking Pool and Upfront Pool

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
