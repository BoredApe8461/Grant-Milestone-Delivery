**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

> As W3F does not anymore offer payments in ETH, we switched to payment in USD in the submitted invoice

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Interstellar-Network.md

* **Milestone Number:**  3

**Context** (optional)

This milestone focuses on  the implementation of our Trusted Transaction Validation Protocol TTVP client 
on mobile devices. We have in the previous milestone demonstrated how display circuits are produced by Garbled Circuits Factory to be validated with TTVP pallet.
We now demonstrate the TTVP client within a wallet on a mobile devices registered with the mobile TEE registry pallet on the blockchain. 
The TTVP client enables hardware-backed higly secure validation/confirmation of transactions or sensitive operations to be executed by blockchain TEE nodes.
> We have experienced unexpected complexity and issues especially related to low level Rust/C++ implementation of our TTVP client on mobile devices, especially with the renderer layer. On top of that we have also started to implement our CI workflow. All this have generated a significant delay for this miletsone  delivery.
