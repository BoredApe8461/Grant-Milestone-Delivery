* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Interstellar-Network.md

* **Milestone Number:**  3

**Context** (optional)

This milestone focuses on the on the implementation of Trusted Transaction Validation Protocol TTVP client 
on mobile devices. We have in the previous milestone demonstrated how display circuits are produced by Garbled Circuits Factory to be validated 
with TTVP pallet.
We now demonstrate the TTVP client within a wallet on a mobile devices registered with the mobile TEE registry pallet.
on the blockchain. 
The TTVP client enable the validation/confirmation of a transaction or sensitive operation to be executed later on the blockchain.
