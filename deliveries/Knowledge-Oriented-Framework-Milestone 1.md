* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Knowledge-Oriented-Framework.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context** (optional)
> The milestone 1 encompasses the creation of a literature review and the conceptual framework specification.

**Deliverables**
> The conducted systematic literature review [1] identified, evaluated, and synthesized evidence related to the general application of semantic web technologies in Web3. It also assessed the literature available referring to the Polkadot ecosystem in that matter.
> 
> The first draft version of POnto formalizes key concepts along with their relationships and provides a structured representation of the Polkadot Ecosystem. It enables reuse of domain knowledge and also its natural expansion. The goal is to use the ontology to support development of applications and tools to interact with the Polkadot Ecosystem more consistently.
