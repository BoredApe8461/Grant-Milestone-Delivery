* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Knowledge-Oriented-Framework.md
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** (optional)
> The milestone 2 encompasses conducting a case study to explore the future application of the proposed ontological framework to support building a controlled natural language (CNL) and a query engine service in Polkadot’s multi-chain ecosystem, called Polkadot Analytics.

**Deliverables**
> The case study provides insights for developers and software architects in designing and building query engine tools to retrieve and analyze blockchain data from the Polkadot network and its parachains. The identified use cases, driven by a controlled natural language (CNL) and the POnto ontology, offer a path for tool development.

**Additional Information**
> The POnto specification and the delivered technical reports are currently in draft version, as expected. They will be changed and altered throughout the research process.

> We need support regarding the proposed pilot testing and data collection steps, which should be defined along with the Web3 Foundation grants program team, as part of the next milestone (M3) of our roadmap. We need to define the best strategy for selecting representative participants for surveying as well as the brainstorming / workshop proposed for M3.
