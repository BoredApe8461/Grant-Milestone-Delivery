* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Knowledge-Oriented-Framework.md
* **Milestone Number:** 3

**Context** (optional)
> An important aspect of creating an ontology is to engage with experts from application domains to gain their insights and perspectives. This engagement helps to ensure that the ontological framework is grounded in real-world experience and reflects the current understanding of representative personas in the applied fields. In this sense, a key step of the proposed approach is to present and discuss the ontology with the Polkadot team.

**Deliverables**
> We wrote an article reporting the scientific findings regarding the proposed conceptual framework that includes a domain ontology called POnto (a Polkadot Ontology). POnto provides a structured representation of the ecosystem's concepts and relationships, enabling a formal understanding of the platform. The proposed knowledge-oriented approach enhances integration and communicability, enabling a wider range of users to participate in the ecosystem and facilitating the development of AI-based applications.
