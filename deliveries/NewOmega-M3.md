| Number | Deliverable | Link | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense | - |
| 0b. | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can run the contracts which will show how the new functionality works. | See Documentation on [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/WiktorStarczewski/newomega-polkadot-hybrid/tree/m3/newomega-capacitor-polkadot) |
| 0c. | The code will have unit-test coverage (min. 70%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | See Documentation on [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/WiktorStarczewski/newomega-polkadot-hybrid/tree/m3/newomega-capacitor-polkadot) for Testing | |
| 0d. | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant. | [Article](https://wiktorstarczewski.medium.com/persistent-universe-comes-to-newomega-f8bf99851d72) |
| 1. | We will implement betting in the game client / contracts for ranked fights | [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/WiktorStarczewski/newomega-polkadot-hybrid/tree/m3/newomega-capacitor-polkadot) |
| 2. | The client will become a hybrid app, in addition to playable on web, it will be packaged and deployed on Google Play Store, and ready to deploy on Apple App Store (NOTE, Apple policies currently prevent submitting blockchain apps, and that is unlikely to change for the duration of this grant). | [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.celrisen.newomega) |
| 3. | We will implement modules in the game engine, with the ability to fire effects (snare, root, blind, debuffs) at a specific % chance during the fight. | [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/WiktorStarczewski/newomega-polkadot-hybrid/tree/m3/newomega-capacitor-polkadot) |
| 4. | We will implement the ability to change targeting of ships, in the engine and UI. | [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/WiktorStarczewski/newomega-polkadot-hybrid/tree/m3/newomega-capacitor-polkadot) |
| 5. | We will implement the Universe mode, with territory exploration and ship production as described in Roadmap | [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/WiktorStarczewski/newomega-polkadot-hybrid/tree/m3/newomega-capacitor-polkadot) |
