**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [Omniverse DLT](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Omniverse%20DLT.md).
* **PR Link:** [Omniverse DLT](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1431), [update proposal](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1475)
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

* In this milestone, we have finished create `Swap` pallet, user can add liquidity and make exchanges for two different o-tokens.
* In this milestone, we have finished the `Omniverse-DLT` protocol in `Ink!` technology stack for fungible token, it have the same functions as the `assets pallet` in milestone 1.
* We have enhanced the related off-chain tools to operate `o-tokens` both on the Parachain of Polkadot and EVM chains.
* We have provided incredibly convenient testing tools for deploying and testing the entire process.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

| 4. | Off-Chain Synchronizer | [link](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/omniverse-synchronizer/tree/milestone-2) | We have optimized the synchronizer, improving its efficiency, added support for ink! parachain, and provided deployment through Docker. |

**Additional Information**  
* Here is the [GitHub of O-DLT](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs). 

#### **Works until now**  

Currently, we have finished the basic functions of `O-DLT` protocol, and provided four tech stack implementations:  

- [Ethereum (EVMs)](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/omniverse-evm/tree/web3-grant)
- Polkadot
  - [Pallet](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/omniverse-swap/tree/web3-grant)
  - [Ink!](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/omniverse-ink)
 - [Flow](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/omniverse-flow)

And an application of `O-DLT` protocol:

- [Omniverse Swap](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/omniverse-swap/tree/milestone-2/pallets/omni-swap)

#### **Future Work**  

We will continue to dedicate ourselves to the improvement of `O-DLT` protocol and explore further applications based on it.
