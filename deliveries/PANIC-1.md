**Context** 

PANIC is a monitoring and alering tool for node operators. This version brings PANIC closer to the Substrate validator community through the introduction of high priority monitorables.  
Operators can now monitor and be alerted on their nodes (non-validator and validator) and on the networks their nodes are connected to.
