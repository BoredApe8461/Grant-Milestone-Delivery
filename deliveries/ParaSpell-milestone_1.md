**Additional Information**
Every aspect of project, that was defined in proposal, was implemented according to it. There was only one change which had no effect on application and was approved by W3F team in following [commit 1145](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1145) was change of nodes that were not yet fully compatible together. Making them compatible was not part of proposal. We plan on making follow-up grant proposal once we compile all new ideas that can make ParaSpell better.
