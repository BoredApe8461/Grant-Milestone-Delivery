**Context**

We are pleased to present our project deliverables for the Polkadot Protocol Conformance Tests RFP research grant that we undertook. Our team wants to express gratitude to the Web3 Foundation for the opportunity to work on this project. The reasearch was productive with multiple findings and suggestions. During the research the team expanded itâ€™s knowledge about critical modules of the Polkadot Host, inner-workings of Zombienet, and testing best practices. The whole research is structured in a document, linked in the deliverables below.
