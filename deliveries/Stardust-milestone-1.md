**Context** (optional)

This is the associated deliverable for milestone 1, an overall summary of the state of the stablecoin industry with a focus on the current market landscape, existing technologies, economic and business fundamentals, and profit drivers. In our analysis, we determined a graphic rich, data heavy presentation would best communicate the material. We have provided both the .pdf and the raw PowerPoint in the attached GitHub repository. Note: All sources are cited in the notes section of the PowerPoint under each slide, our exported PDF contains only the final slide data.
