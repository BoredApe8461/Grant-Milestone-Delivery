# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**

* **Application Document:** [SubIdentity Application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/SubIdentity.md)
* **Milestone Number:** 3

**Context**

A basic application with a responsive design to search for identities by address and identity fields was developed as part of milestone 1. Milestone 2 focused on improving the web application's performance and adding the feature to connect to a custom node by providing the node endpoint.
As part of milestone 1, a user could, by default, query identities from Polkadot, Kusama or Westend. With milestone 2, any node whose respective chain implements the identity pallet can be added and used to lookup identities. 

By default, the SubIdentity web application uses the SubIdentity npm package to search identities on the respective chain for a provided node. The SubIdentity package contains required methods and interfaces for the SubIdentity web application, and the SubIdentity backend to search for identities on a substrate based chain implementing the identity pallet.
The SubIdentity backend was developed as part of milestone 2 to provide the SubIdentity web application with an API to search for identities with higher performance. Therefore, the SubIdentity backend provides the feature to index identities for a substrate based chain that implements the identity pallet by providing an endpoint for an archive node.

During the development of the 3. milestone we focused on the implementation of the Governance and Tresaury plugin. Therefore an indexer script was developed. The indexer can index a Substrate based blockchain to fetch detail information about identities. Besides that, a listener script keeps the cached data updated on our side.


**Deliverables**

Deliverables are three Github repositories:
* [web application](https://github.com/TDSoftware/subidentity-webapp)

**Additional Information**

The developed web application is hosted at https://subidentity.tdsoftware.de/. For testing we indexed the whole Polkadot chain to retrieve Treasury and Governance information. Next we are considering a follow up production ready version of the application.
We provided a public available high-fidelity, pixel perfect [design](https://www.figma.com/file/Rn8xSxi3flRBJ0Nf0GKWeK/SubIdentity-Public) too.
