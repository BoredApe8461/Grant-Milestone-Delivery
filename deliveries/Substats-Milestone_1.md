| 0b.    | Documentation           | [README.md](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/README.md) | We provided both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how to use the product, display and explain the function of each component. |
| 0c.    | Testing Guide           | [testing-guide.md](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/documents/testing-guide.md) | Unit testing could be applied to ensure reliability. Documentation of tests and results will be provided. |
| 1a.    | Develop the webservice  | [about-framework.md](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/documents/about-framework.md) | We used the express.js framework to build the basic back-end services, and installed the database link toolkit to achieve stable network communication, database connection and other functions to prepare for upper-layer applications. |
| 1b.    | Develop the polkadot.js | Connect to the RPC node<br /> [https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/bll/init-polkadot-api.js#L22](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/bll/init-polkadot-api.js#L22)<br /><br />Get block info and transfer<br />[https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/sync-block/index.js#L44](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/sync-block/index.js#L44)<br /><br />Get block events by block hash<br />[https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/sync-block/index.js#L52](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/sync-block/index.js#L52)<br /><br />Account query<br />[https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/timer/get-accounts.js#L38](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/timer/get-accounts.js#L38)<br /><br />Miner query<br />[https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/timer/get-miners.js#L32](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/app/timer/get-accounts.js#L38)<br /><br />Subscribe new block header<br />[https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/bll/sub.js#L19](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/bll/sub.js#L19) | We used the polkadot.js API to interact with the PRC nodes of the blockchain network developed based on Substrate. And implemented interfaces including block query, transaction query, Account query, Miner query, and new block subscription. |
| 1c.    | Develop the API         | [api-docs.md](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/documents/api-docs.md) | We defined the back-end API specification for the front-end service to call, including the data structure, request parameters, request event processing function, return data format, etc. At the same time, we implemented the construction of the interface layer to meet the custom development needs of developers. |
| 1d.    | Create the database     | [about-database.md](https://github.com/CESSProject/substats/blob/master/documents/about-database.md) | We built MySQL database service, created table structure, completed index creation, data structure constraints, and implemented MYSQL connection driver through Node.js. |
