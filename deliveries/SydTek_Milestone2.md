* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/SydTek.md
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context**
This deliverable is for the research study and for the interviews with individuals from the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems on how the social recovery pallet could be integrated into their projects. The transcripts from those interviews, along with interviews from Joe Petrowski and Shawn Tabrizi of Parity and Tyler Doussan of SafeHaven are included in Deliverable 1 below. Additionally, after speaking with Jûrgen Schouppe - the CEO and Founder of SafeHaven and reviewing the case study with him, he is looking to take the proposed recommendations highlighted in the study and develop a digital inheritance solution on Kusama. As SafeHaven currently offers a digital inheritance solution on VeChain - https://safehaven.io/ - once Milestone 3 is completed and the journal article is submitted to IEEE, we look to submit a follow-up grant to develop this proposed solution.

The initial pass for the journal article (1a) has been added to the Developed Materials folder in GitHub, and the IEEE-formatted version can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ULAgya391V04YvbEJeY4zESm08ifCFX2/edit
