* **Milestone Number:** 3

**Context**
This deliverable is for the ArXiv research study that can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11074. The IEEE article was submitted and was returned for minor revisions. Those revisions have be resubmitted and we are awaiting a response. As the Arxiv article was published on January 26, 2023, at the direction of @keeganquigley, we are submitting this milestone so it can be closed.

Additionally, the study has already been referenced by academic researchers at Sikkim University in an article entitled Web3: A comprehensive review on background, technologies, applications, zero-trust architectures, challenges and future directions. That article can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667345223000305.

|      0. | Rights  |https://github.com/jgophd/Developed-Materials-and-Raw-Data | All developed materials and raw data will be publicly accessible and public domain via a GitHub repository. Milestone 3 is research oriented and as such there is no code to test.                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  **1.** | Submit to OA journal |The SydTek team submit the completed journal article for publication in a peer-reviewed open access journal to ensure the research is available for everyone. The article can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11074|
| **1a.** | Specific Coverage | The team will hold virtual sessions for univerisities such as Georgetown University in Washington, DC in the United States, McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and at the Kings College School of Law in London, UK to share the findings of the study. These events will also be recorded and held in the metaverse. These will be recorded at a later date. A side event at Coin Bureau Live was performed in London.|
