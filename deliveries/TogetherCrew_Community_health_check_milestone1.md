| 0e. | Article| https://github.com/RnDAO/tc-Documentation/blob/master/Twitter-vibes/Twitter_Community_Vibes.md | We will publish an article (technical document) describing the metrics, the insights (so-what), and limitations. This article will also explain how the Twitter community is build (e.g., who are nodes, when there is an edge between two people, who is excluded/included and why). We will build a directed network, where nodes are always Twitter users. From a network assembly perspective, we will not differentiate between accounts representing people and those representing communities or organizations. The edges between an user profiles are either a reply, quote, mention, retweets, or likes. Thus, a tie from user A to user B exists if (1) user A replies to user B, user A quotes user B, user A mentions user B, user A retweets user B, or user A likes user B's tweet. At this moment, we will created weighted edges, not making a conceptual difference between the interaction type (reply, quote, mention, retweets and likes).The article will not be behind a paywall. The article will be written for an audience comfortable with data analysis. |
