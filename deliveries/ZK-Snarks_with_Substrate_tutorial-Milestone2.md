| -----: | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense | MIT license can be found [here](https://github.com/bright/zk-snarks-with-substrate/tree/main/LICENSE). |
| **0b.** | Documentation |Documentation can be found in the [README](https://github.com/bright/zk-snarks-with-substrate/tree/main/pallets/zk-snarks/README.md) file. | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a tutorial (which will be a part of the blog post) that explains how a user can (for example) spin up Substrate nodes and upload a verification key and the proof. This will show how the new functionality works. | 
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | [Repository](https://github.com/bright/zk-snarks-with-substrate/) |Run `cargo test` in project's root directory. |
| **0d.** | Docker | [Repository](https://github.com/bright/zk-snarks-with-substrate/) | Run `docker-compose up` in project's root directory
