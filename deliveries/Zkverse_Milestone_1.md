**Context**
This deliver focus on how to verify the proof generated by snarkjs on substrate-based chain and provide some practice about the zk circuits.

**Additional Information**
In this milestone, we have implemented the complete zkp verification process, generating proofs with snarkjs, verifying them with bellman, and demonstrating how zkp works through specific circuits. This helps developers better understand how to use zkp in practical applications within the Polkadot ecosystem. Specifically, we have implemented the simplest Merkle tree circuit in rollup. In the following milestones, we will further improve this circuit to include account properties.
