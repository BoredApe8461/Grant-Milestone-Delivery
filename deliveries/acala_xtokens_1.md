| 0a. | License Apache 2.0 |https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/blob/master/LICENSE| ...| 
| 0b.  | Documentation |https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/xtokens| Inline docs and readme available|
| 0c.  | Unit test | [unit test](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/xtokens#integration-tests) | `xcm-support` tests are included, use `check-tests` to see. `xtokens` would require XCM simulator to test cumulus, so we can only include it once [this](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2544) is done. However we have included integration tests guide [here](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/xtokens#integration-tests)| 
| 1.  | xtokens pallet | https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/xtokens | these pallets already work on the latest Rococo testnet |
| 2.  | xcm-support pallet | https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/xcm-support | | 
| 3.  | Articles/Tutorials | https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/wiki/xtokens | This wiki guide has documented how to integrate xtokens for fungible asset transfer, configure parachain assets to work with one another, and also launch HRMP Channel on Rococo for testing. The parachain teams listed [here](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/wiki/xtokens#composablewith) have either integrated and tested with Acala such as Laminar (used as example), [Plasm](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/the-first-successful-cross-chain-messaging-passing-xcmp-transaction-on-polkadot-testnet-eb36af2ad8c3) and [HydraDX](https://twitter.com/AcalaNetwork/status/1367311232903110656?s=20), or are work-in-processing integrating xtokens |
