| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | Implementing the Library |Repo Link: [https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec](https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec) <br> Release: [version 0.0.2](https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec/releases/tag/0.0.2)| All of the specified types have been implemented, excluding the `Tuples`. We had technical dificulties implementing a general `Tuples` encoder/decoder due to AssemblyScript limitations (AS does not support reflection and `tuples`). After consulting with the AssemblyScript Dev team, we've decided to mitigate the task by not implementing a general `Tuples` encoder/decoder, but rather implement the concrete Objects (`Block`, `Extrinsic` etc..). We will be extending the library with the object types while we are working on the AS Runtime Generation. | 
| 2.  | Unit Tests |Tests: [https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec/tree/master/assembly/__tests__](https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec/tree/master/assembly/__tests__) <br> Release: [version 0.0.2](https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec/releases/tag/0.0.2)| There are unit tests for all of the supported types. | 
| 3.  | Documentation |[https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec](https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec)| Documentation on how to import and use all of the types is provided, as well as instructions on how to run the unit tests of the library.|
