We used scripted in-game actions (e.g. open a chest, defeat an NPC), which triggers the on-chain minting of Item and handles its result |
| 3.     | In-game items association | - | This deliverable is related to the Creators Studio web app |
| 3.1    | In-game items association | [Create blueprint from pattern](https://gitlab.com/asylum-space/asylum-ui/-/commit/736f86fb4036afd464cb3ab139cfb626f318df78), [Testing guide](https://docs.asylum.space/tutorials/testing-guide-patterns#case-1-creating-a-blueprint-from-a-pattern) | Implemented the ability to create Blueprint with specific Interpretations required by Game Client to associate it with in-game item |
