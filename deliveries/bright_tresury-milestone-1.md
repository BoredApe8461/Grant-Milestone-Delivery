**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSqj2vYjvpiIytkjcc40Pwl0Eg76WGUAq5L9e8eFuuOegmLw/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **PR Link:** [Pull Request](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/251). 
* **Application Document:** [https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/bright_treasury.md](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/bright_treasury.md)

> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury). Please use the [milestone1 branch](https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury/tree/milestone1) for testing purposes.
