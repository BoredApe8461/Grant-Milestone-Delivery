* **PR Link:** [Pull Request](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/251). 
* **Application Document:** [https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/bright_treasury.md](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/bright_treasury.md)

> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
The code is available [here](https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury). Please use the [milestone2 branch](https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury/tree/milestone2) for testing purposes.

|	Number	|	Deliverable	|	Link	|	Notes	|
|	-------------	|	-------------	|	-------------	|-------------	|
|	1.	|	Testing environment	|	We provide an [online testing environment](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/stats) with a dedicated Polkadot development node (access available via [Polkadot JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftesting.treasury.brightinventions.pl%3A9944#/chainstate)) to demonstrate the full functionality of our app. All the links below lead to this testing app.
|	2.	|	User story 14 - As a user, I can switch between networks and see data for the selected network.	|	Click the arrow next to a network's logo, in the top left corner of [the app](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/) to display the list of networks. |  Choose the network you wish to switch to. You should be redirected to the chosen network version of the app. 
|	3.	|	User story 15 - As an idea owner, I can add an idea and milestones to multiple networks.	|	 [Add a new Idea](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/stats?networkId=development-2)	|	Fill in the details of the idea and click "+Additional Net". A form should slide down allowing to choose the additional net data. An Idea can be added to as many networks as the application currently supports. Click "Create" button. The Idea should appear on the list of current network's Ideas. Switch to the other network in which the Idea was added. The Idea should be visible in the Ideas overview of this network as well. The milestones of the Idea belong to the same set of networks as the Idea. 
|	4.	|	User story 16 - As an idea owner, I can submit my proposal into multiple networks (signing and submitting one transaction for each added network).  |	 Go to [my ideas list](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/ideas?filter=mine) and select the created Idea which was added to multiple networks	| Click the "Convert to proposal button" and follow the instructions. The Idea should be added as a proposal in the current network. In the Idea overview of the other network should gain the status "Pending". Idea can be then submitted as a proposal in the other, current network, gaining the status "Turned into Proposal" in the current network. 
|	5.	|	User story 17 - As an idea owner, I can submit each milestone separately as a proposal into multiple networks (signing and submitting a separate transaction for each milestone for each added network). One milestone at a time.	|	Go to [mine ideas list](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/ideas?filter=mine) and select the idea. 	|	Click on the "Milestones" button. If there are no milestones added yet, please add at least one. Then click on a milestone and in a window with milestone details click "Convert to Proposal" button. Follow the instructions in the subsequent screens. When the milestone is successfully submitted as a proposal, it should appear in the Proposals list for a given network. In the Ideas overview, the parent Idea gains status "Milestone submissions". The originating Idea milestone gains status "Turned into Proposal" in the current network and "Pending" in other networks. Upon switching to other applicable networks, it should be possible to repeat the steps for these networks. Status "Pending" should then transform into "Turned into Proposal".
|	6.	|	User story 18 - As a user, I can view stats of the treasury module	|	[https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/stats?networkId=polkadot](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/stats?networkId=polkadot)	|  The statistics presented on the page (for Proposals Submitted, Proposals Approved, Active Ideas, Spend Period details and budget) should present the same values as statistics in the [Polkadot.js app](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/treasury) 
|	7.	|	User story 19 - As a logged in user I can discuss the idea.	|	Go to [Ideas list](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/?networkId=development-2) as a logged in user	|	Select an idea and choose the Discussion tab. Place a text in the comment box and press send. The comment should appear on the list.
|	8.	|	User story 20 - As a logged in user I can see notification about new comments (in my idea and in ideas I have discussed on)	|	The top bar - [bell icon](https://testing.treasury.brightinventions.pl/) and the Discussion tab of a chosen Idea	|   Place a comment in the Discussion tab of a chosen Idea proposed by user B, being logged in as a user A. Logout and login as user B. There should be a blue dot on menu bell icon and after clicking on it, a list containing information about the new comment should appear. In the details menu of the commented Idea a red dot should appear upon the Discussion button.
|	9.	|	User story 21 - As a logged in user I can get email notifications about new comments (in my idea and in ideas I have discussed on)	|	|	Place a comment in the Discussion tab of a chosen Idea proposed by user B, being logged in as a user A.
