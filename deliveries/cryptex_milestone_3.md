# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/cryptex.md
* **Milestone Number:** 3

**Context**

The Etf Network is a Substrate-based blockchain that utilizes identity-based encryption and zero knowledge proofs to enable "encryption to the future", or timelock encryption. It uses a slot-based consensus system as a reference clock to which messages can be encrypted. The initial implementation uses a fork of Aura to implement a proof-of-authority version of ETF, where authorities are IBE master key custodians. Valid blocks authored in future slots contain the corresponding secret keys. To put it another way, each slot has a unique, publicly calculable identity, and whenever a block is authored in that slot, the identity owners leaks their secret key.

In the third milestone we deliver an initial use case on the etf network, a second-price sealed-bid auction NFT platform. The auction takes advantage of the timelock encryption implemented in the previous milestone to seal bids for auction participants.

**Additional Information**

- in the [previous milestone delivery](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/985), we discussed some potential optimizations of the encryption scheme. Rather than expand the scope of this grant to include this optimization (likely requiring an ammendment and re-approval), we opted to include it in the next phase of the project.
