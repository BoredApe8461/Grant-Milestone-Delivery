# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

> Only the GitHub account, which is responsible for the pull request of the accepted application is allowed to submit milestones. Don't remove any of the mandatory parts presented in bold letters or as headlines!
**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://forms.gle/8Wx7nxtq8fKrsuEz8) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **PR Link:** https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/225 
* **Milestone Number:** 1

Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which should be used for testing.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | Assets will be handled using a new assets trait. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/milestone-2/pallets/equilibrium-curve-amm/src/lib.rs#L1506 |  | 
| 2. | We will implement a pool storage structure for handling different asset pools with different parameters. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/milestone-2/pallets/equilibrium-curve-amm/src/lib.rs#L1543 |  |
| 3. | We will implement methods to set up custom asset pools. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/milestone-2/pallets/equilibrium-curve-amm/src/lib.rs#L332 |  |
| 4.a. | We will implement a method to iteratively calculate Curve’s invariant D non-overflowing integer operations. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/milestone-2/pallets/equilibrium-curve-amm/src/lib.rs#L1129 |  |
| 4.b. | We will implement a method to iteratively calculate points on the bonding curve in non-overflowing integer operations. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/milestone-2/pallets/equilibrium-curve-amm/src/lib.rs#L1198 |  |
| 5. | The code will have complete unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm/blob/milestone-2/reports/tarpaulin-report.html |  |
| 6. | We will publish the code in the Equilibrium’s public GitHub repository. | https://github.com/equilibrium-eosdt/equilibrium-curve-amm |  |
