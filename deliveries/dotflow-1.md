**Context**

We are submitting the delivery of all the functionality specified in the grant application for the first milestone.
The list of things we implemented in this milestone:
- Identity contract with all the functionality we promised to do in the grant application.
- Tests for identity contract. We covered every part of the contract code with ink! integration tests to ensure everything works as supposed.
- Contract documentation. We have added a lot of comments in the code, as well as in the test to make sure everything is easy to understand.
- My Identity UI with all the functionality we promised to do in the grant application.
- Address encryption. As promised in the grant application we encrypt addresses before storing them in the identity contract to ensure privacy.
