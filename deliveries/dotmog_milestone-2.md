| 0a. | License | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/origin/LICENSE) |Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/origin/README.md) | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/origin/README.md#testing-guide) |  The code will have unit-test coverage (min. 70%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/origin/README.md) | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant. 
| 1. | Basic API | done | Second Round of refactoring and restructure the API |
| 2. | Subscriptions | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/983b77efa4460eae413c52fe284c31123bd5a6c7/SubstrateNetApi/Modules/State.cs#L100) | Implement basic subscriptions | 
| 2a. | Subscriptions | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/origin/SubstrateNetApi/SubscriptionListener.cs) | Implement generic Callback for handling multiple subscriptions with subscriptionId |

| 2c. | Unit Tests | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/origin/SubstrateNetApiTest/Subscription/SubscriptionTest.cs) | Create unit test for subscriptions |
| 3. | Refactoring | done | Refactor type converters to be generic and reusable inheriting from IType, BaseType & Struct Type |
| 4. | Pallet | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/SubstrateNetApi/blob/9bea9a4dacda64d83d7dc9606f6a4e5c9af9fd2b/SubstrateNetApi/Modules/Author.cs#L40) | DotMogPallet add base functionality, MogwaiStruct, AccountConfig & BreedType | 
| 5. | Pallet | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/pallet-dotmog) | DotMogPallet add pairing algorithm and MogwaiBios |
| 6. | Update | [LINK](https://github.com/dotmog/substrate/commit/92a898c5f9f92d59cf10980f9f1623c70ffef39d#diff-572d688bd26b0a2a2fa69c889d99057d0fa1c21dcdaa4e345f5733b61a90336d) | Update to Substrate v3.0/0.9 â€“ Apollo 14, adjust types |

Sidenote: We are currently refactoring our closed source GameEngine to a domain driven design, we will reapply for a follow up grant which will contain the API and an open sourced GameEngine, ready to use in unity as an free unity asset.
