# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:


**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/dtuzi/Grants-Program/blob/4d5e7ff1cc90ab0416604dc705bd02c29ba136e6/applications/Eiger_Storage_on_Polkadot_1.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**

Our main goal is to describe how to implement and maintain a Filecoin-like system parachain -- a parachain that uses DOT as the native token and is easily usable for all kinds of parachain projects in the ecosystem via XCM.

We also update [research done previously](https://github.com/common-good-storage) to reflect the latest technical changes in Polkadot and Substrate. We wanted to figure out what it would take to implement a whole storage solution as a parachain without depending on 3rd party chains and evaluate what components need to be written from scratch and what can be reused.

**Additional Information**

In our conclusion, we outlined [28 work milestones](https://github.com/eigerco/polkadot-native-storage/blob/main/doc/report/src/new-conclusion.md#31-implementation) that would deliver immutable native storage for Polkadot.
