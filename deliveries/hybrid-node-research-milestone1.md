| 1. | Research Report | We will provide a detailed report covering the review of specifications and conformance tests, the review of Polkadot Host (Parity)and the findings from the re-work of the module and primitives including recommendation practices based on this proof of concept.                                    | [Link](https://github.com/Zondax/mayon/blob/main/docs/report/HybridHost_Zondax_Report.pdf) 
| 2. | PoC code| We will provide the code from the re-worked primitives.We plan to promote modularity and replace parts of the reference node by rewriting them in C/C++.  <br/> Note: This will not be production-ready code. It is just meant to be used as a proof of concept and to inform future development plans. | [Mayon](https://github.com/Zondax/mayon) / [Host node fork](https://github.com/Zondax/polkadot/tree/poc_hybrid) |

**Additional Information**
The task of rewriting the Polkadot host node in C++ using a hybrid approach is a challenging but exciting opportunity. 
Despite the complexity of the original projectâ€™s dependencies and difficulties in asynchronous programming, the team is confident in completing the project with careful planning and a modular approach. We believe in the positive impact this project can bring on the Polkadot ecosystem.
