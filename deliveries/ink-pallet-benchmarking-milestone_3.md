**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  I tried filling the form but encountered an error when I was trying to submit it.

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/ink-pallet-benchmarking-phase-2.md 
* **Milestone Number:** 3

**Context** (optional)
There are multiple ways to implement the logic in substrate i.e using pallets or ink smart contracts, or even writing solidity code and compiling it to WASM with the help of a solang compiler. We have to benchmark the performance metrics of the logic implemented using each of the above methods. We have already benchmarked the storage performance(basic data types) of each of the implementations as part of Milestone 1 and 2. Now, we will benchmark CPU-intensive logic, events emission and cross-contract calls across all the four implementations. We hope this will help new developers in deciding the best approach to implement the logic.

| 1. | Pallet CPU-intensive extrinsic | https://github.com/Nikhil-Desai-Talentica/substrate-node-template-benchmarking/blob/contracts-benchmarking/pallets/template/src/lib.rs | Three compute-intensive candidates are chosen. |

| 3. | Solidity-WASM and Solidity-Native CPU-intensive function | https://github.com/Nikhil-Desai-Talentica/substrate-node-template-benchmarking/blob/contracts-benchmarking/solidity-sample-contract/sample.sol | The same three compute-intensive candidates are chosen. |

| 5. | Pallet cross-contract call | https://github.com/Nikhil-Desai-Talentica/substrate-node-template-benchmarking/blob/contracts-benchmarking/pallets/callee/src/lib.rs | The template pallet calls this callee pallet's extrinsic. |
| 6. | Ink! cross-contract call | https://github.com/Nikhil-Desai-Talentica/substrate-node-template-benchmarking/blob/contracts-benchmarking/inner/lib.rs | The sample test Ink! smart contract calls the inner contract's exposed function. |
| 7. | cross-contract benchmarks | https://talenticaall-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/nikhil_desai_talentica_com/ESEnZ3pFvdhHi4_8VLlQLWYBKEhAuUz5_ee5gSPnKYMSkw?e=zZmrMS | The table within the document shows how each implementation performs. |
| 8. | Solidity-WASM and Solidity-Native cross-contract call | Add another Solidity contract and invoke it from the sample Solidity contract. (Note: There are [unresolved issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/issues/666) questioning the feasibility of cross-contract calls in Solidity-WASM and Solidity-Native. Nevertheless, an attempt will be made to see if it's possible. | An attempt was made to benchmark cross-contract call from Solidity-Native to another contract of the same implementation, however it couldn't be done. |
