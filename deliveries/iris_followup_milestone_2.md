# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/iris_followup.md
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context**

This milestone delivers the infrastructure to ingest data into the network and delegate decryption rights to authorized nodes.

* To securely ingest data, we implement two new RPC endpoints, 'iris_encrypt' that allows a node to encrypt data using proxy reencryption, and 'iris_decrypt' .
* We create two new node types, a 'proxy' node which enables the proxy reencryption mechanism and a 'gateway' node, which enables data ingestion and asset class creation.
* We reintegrate with IPFS by making http calls using the offchain client. We also build a module to bridge between IPFS and Iris.
* We modify the user interface to provide a simple way to start the ingestion process, view data about asset classes, and ultimately to decrypt and download data.

See the medium article, tech docs, and demo video for deeper context and more information.

**Additional Information**

In general, as part of the test setup we rely on a small three-validator testnet that we setup on AWS using t2.micro instances. Full access to these instances can be provided to whoever is performing the testing on this milestone. We'll provide a .pem that you can use to ssh into each instance. To setup your own testnet, you can see the hosted node setup guide linked in deliverable number 7. There is a script that can be run in any linux distro that will install iris and dependencies, and from there it's only a matter of running three validators to get block finalization to start.
