## Additional Information
All deliverables mentioned in this milestone are foundational and will undergo enhancements in the future. For a deeper understanding of each deliverable, we recommend referring to the individual `README.md` files associated with each folder.

Folders contained within [LasticUI](https://github.com/LasticXYZ/LasticUI)
- `./static_frontend`
- `./substrate_interact`
- `./core_chain_sdk`

In the future, these folders will be merged into a unified structure. Specifically, the `core_chain_sdk` is in its nascent stage and only contains boilerplate code. However, it will soon have its dedicated repository, ensuring a more streamlined development and integration process.
