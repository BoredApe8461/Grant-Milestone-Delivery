# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

> ⚡ Only the GitHub account that submitted the application is allowed to submit milestones.

> Don't remove any of the mandatory parts presented in bold letters or as headlines! Lines starting with `>`, such as this one, can be removed.

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** In the case of a public [Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program) application, please provide a link to the merged contract (the `.md` file in the [applications](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications) directory). In the case of a private application, please provide the name of the project. 
* **Milestone Number:** e.g. 1

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| **0a.** | License | https://github.com/LasticXYZ/LasticUI/blob/main/LICENSE | Licensed under GPLv3 |
| **0b.** | Documentation | All documentation is in the READMEs of the coresponding folders. https://github.com/LasticXYZ/LasticUI/blob/main/README.md | Comprehensive documentation will include inline code comments and a detailed wiki. The wiki will clarify core terms such as “coretime” and “assignments” for user understanding. This will be a one-stop resource for insights into coretime's intricacies and functionalities. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide |  | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive UI testing framework to ensure functionality and robustness. UI Testing involves making sure all functionality works as intended, and from different browsers, OSs and platforms. On MacOS, Linux, and Windows, we will test browsers including, but not limited to: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Brave and Safari for iOS and Chrome on Android. We will test for consistency across platforms and browsers, ensuring all navigational elements work, all graphics are rendered correctly, all data is updated in a timely fashion, for mobile responsiveness, and that there are no unintended results. |
| **0d.** | Error logging |  | In the event of an error, we will ensure the UI writes the error details to an event viewer or log file for later review. |

| 1. | Whitepaper creation | Comprehensive Lastic whitepaper creation. |
| 2a. | User Flow Diagram Design | A user-centric flow diagram will be designed to showcase the interaction journey on the platform. This design will be in line with the principles highlighted in the RFC for coretime chain and broker pallet. It will primarily cover the instantaneous coretime sales and primary market sales, leaving out the secondary market. The finalized user flow diagram will be accessible via a link in the LasticUI repository's README.md file. |
| 2b. | UI Figma Design | We will craft a Figma-based UI design for the coretime chain, with the focus on instantaneous coretime sales and primary market sales (excluding the secondary market). This task will be undertaken without the aid of a professional designer. Preliminary mockups for this stage have been initiated and further details can be gleaned from the expansion of section 3.b. The complete design will be shared through a link in the LasticUI repository's README.md file. |
| 3a. | Frontend Development - Broker Pallet Integration | This phase will integrate basic interactions available in the `broker pallet` into the frontend. Detailed insights into the interactable features can be found in the expanded section of 3.a. Key deliverables will encompass the inclusion of all listed UI extrinsic functions, relevant UI constants, and selected UI storage queries limited to the fuctionality that can be implemented locally. More details are available in the expansion of 3.a section. |
| 3b. | Mockup-based Frontend Development | We will bring to life the mockups for both Instantaneous Coretime sales and the primary market for Bulk Coretime sales as visualized in the UI designs under section 2.b. These mockups will due to limitations of time restirictions only feature "fake data" and not the actual data from the coretime chain. To get an in-depth view of these, refer to the expanded details in section 3.b. |
