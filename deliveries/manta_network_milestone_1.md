# Milestone 1 Delivery

## Code Organization

* [pallet-manta-dap](https://github.com/Manta-Network/pallet-manta-dap): the implementation of manta DAP protocol. It implement the following functions:
  - `init`: create a public asset (a.k.a. base token), which is public
  - `transfer`: tranfer the base token from one polkadot address to another
  - `mint`: mint a private token from the public token
  - `manta_transfer`: transfer a private token to a new shielded address
  - `forfeit`: reclaim a public token from a private token
* [manta-node](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-node): Manta substrate node that integrate `manta-dap-pallet`. You can start a manta local testnet using this code.
* [manta-front-end](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-front-end): A minimal web front-end for Manta that is forked from `substrate-front-end-template`.

## Run a Manta Demo

Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-node#demo).

## Run from docker

1. download and run the manta node:
   1. `docker pull mantalab/manta-node:w3f-milestone-1`
   2. `docker container run -p 9944:9944 mantalab/manta-node:w3f-milestone-1`
2. setup the front end 
    1. `git clone https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-front-end`
    2. `cd manta-front-end`
    3. `yarn install`
    4. `yarn start`

## Test Coverage
