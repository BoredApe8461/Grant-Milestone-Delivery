# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [mobile_dapp_connection.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/mobile_dapp_connection.md)
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context**

These deliverables are a set of libraries that allows integrating **Substrate** **dApps** and **Wallets** on iOS and Android using **Tesseract** protocol (see the [previous deliverable](./mobile_dapp_connection-milestone_1.md)).

To achieve the above, we had to build three separate parts:
* [Android IPC transport](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.android)
* [iOS IPC transport](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.swift)
* [Substrate protocol support](https://github.com/tesseract-one/Tesseract.rs/tree/master/protocols/substrate)

All the parts go with the examples. The examples are the best starting point to understand how it works. The testing guide contains instructions on building and running the apps and a detailed explanation of how to work with Tesseract.

**Additional Information**

This deliverable allows dApp and Wallet developers to integrate on mobile platforms.

In the next milestone (number 3), we are building the ultimate integration test (in the form of demo apps) to make sure that all the grant deliverables work perfectly together:
* Tesseract Shared Core
* Tesseract Substrate integration
* iOS and Android IPCs

We understand, though, that using Tesseract by integrating Rust in your application is not for everyone, so the next step after finishing this grant is to build native language wrappers on top, which will make Tesseract work just as any other Kotlin or Swift library.
