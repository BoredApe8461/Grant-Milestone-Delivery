**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/native-bitcoin-vaults.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context** (optional)

We recorded a [video summary and demonstration](https://youtu.be/OYKvt-xir3E) for this milestone.

As mentioned in the proposal, we weren't sure if the `no_std` version of [Bitcoin Dev Kit](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit) would be ready, so we used an offchain worker in the meantime. The `no_std` versions of the dependencies (`rust-bitcoin` and `rust-miniscript`) have been developed but are not yet released. Once those are released, BDK will updated and we will integrate those changes into our solution. You can follow progress with this [open issue](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/205).

Also, instead of using Spectre Desktop or Caravan as the signer, we are using the mobile app [BlueWallet](https://github.com/BlueWallet). It is open source React Native and available on both app stores. This was a bit more difficult because it required the additional deliverable of encoding the payloads as QR codes. However, we believe it is an overall better fit, more secure, and improved UX over the other options.

We also originally intended to use the identity pallet `additional` mapping for storing the `xpub`. However, updating this field drops verification judgements from the identity, which of course would not be a desired effect. Instead, we save the `xpub` with our pallet. There is no impact to user experience.
