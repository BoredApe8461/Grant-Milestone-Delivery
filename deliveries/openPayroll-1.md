**Context** 
We embarked on an ambitious journey to create Open Payroll, a project that leverages the power of blockchain technology to revolutionize payroll systems. Starting from scratch, we faced the challenge of developing every component of this project ourselves. This was no easy task, but it was a process we thoroughly enjoyed.

Our goal was to create a contract that enables anyone to configure and generate their own payroll system, providing a solution for organizations that wish to make transparent payments. We aimed to create a more transparent and secure world, where payments are not only technologically advanced, but also practical and applicable to everyday life.

The development process was a learning curve, as we had to design a user-friendly interface, develop the payroll contract and integrate the UI with the contract. Each step was a challenge in its own right, but we were determined to overcome them.

We are proud to say that the Open Payroll project is a testament to our commitment to leveraging blockchain technology to build real-life solutions.

We are immensely grateful to the Web3 Foundation (w3f) for the opportunity to contribute to the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. This project would not have been possible without their support. We look forward to continuing our work in this space and exploring new ways to leverage blockchain technology for the betterment of society.
