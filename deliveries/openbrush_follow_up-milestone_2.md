# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [OpenBrush follow-up](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/openbrush-follow-up.md).
* **Milestone Number:** 2 milestone of the grant and 4 milestone of the OpenBrush

**Context**

That milestone was related to the creation of the standards and their implementation in OpenBrush.
- [PSP22 - Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/22)
- [PSP34 - Non Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/34)
- [PSP37 - Multi Token standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/37)

Another important delivery was to use the latest ink! in OpenBrush.
We had two PR related to that. First, we started [supporting the `ink!-rc6`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/53), but after some changes in ink! we were unable to use it according to several issues.
After fixing these issues we finally started to [support the latest ink](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/78) again.

Added separate section on how to [manage the structure of the project](https://docs.openbrush.io/smart-contracts/example/overview). Documented all extensions.                  |

The latest usage of the ink! requires usage of the latest `substrate`. At the moment only `substrate-contracts-node` supports it by it takes a lot time to run all integration tests.  |
| 1.     | Create Proposal for Fungible token                                  | [PSP22 - Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/22)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `PSP22` - `Published` state and implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2.     | Implement extensions for tokens                                     | [PSP22 - Burnable, Mintable, Metadata](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/43), [NFT and Multi token - Burnable, Mintable, Metadata](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/45), [PSP22 Extensions](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/47), [Refactor Burnable Mintable for all PSPs](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/73) | Implemented `Burnable`, `Mintable`, `Metadata` extensions for all PSPs. Also implemented `FlashLender` - for `PSP22`, `PSP22Wrapper`, `PSP22TokenTimelock`, `PSP22Capped`, `PSP22Pausable`. Updated contracts to latest changes in OpenZeppelin. |
| 3.     | Create Proposal for Non Fungible token and Multi token              | [PSP34 - Non Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/34), [PSP37 - Multi Token standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/37)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `PSP34` - `Ready for feedback` state and implemented. `PSP37` - `Draft` state and implemented but not fully adapted(waiting for feedback).                                                                                                       |
| 4.     | Use original ink! instead of our own                                | [`ink!-rc6`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/53), [`ink!-rc10`](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/78)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | We've updated and refactored OpenBrush several times to use a new feature from a new ink!.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5.     | Refactor the contracts to be compatible with PSPs                   | [Use `Result` in contracts](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/51), [PSP34 adaption](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/74), [latest ink!](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/78)                                                                                                                                                                | During each big change, all contracts were refactored. We only had a separate refactoring for `PSP34` after the finalization of the vision about the NFT standard.                                                                               |
| 6.     | Refactor the structure of the OpenBrush to provide agnostic traits  | [Agnostic traits](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/58), [Wrappers for traits](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/pull/54)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | It was a big refactoring to support agnostic traits. OpenBrush provides agnostic traits, so with the "wrapper trait" feature, the users can do cross-contract calls only with traits without knowledge about the implementation.                 |
