**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/pallet_supersig.md
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** 

Supersig is like multisig but with superpowers. This means that you have some added features such as :

- you can add and remove members from the supersig.
- you get simpleMajority, instead of fixed thresholds. 
- you get a master superuser feature. A master user always has 50% of the voting power. This means that if a master user is involved in a transaction, only one other person needs to sign in order to approve the transaction for execution. (More than one person can be a master user). 

Supersig is now part of Kabocha parachain's mainnet on Kusama. 

Milestone 1 was about building pallet_supersig's first version. The pallet now allows you to do the abovementioned core functions. 

Milestone 2 is about adding user interface within the "apps" frontend environment. This will be at home in https://apps.decentration.org. 

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
