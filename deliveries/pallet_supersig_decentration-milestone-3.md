**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/pallet_supersig.md
* **Milestone Number:** 3

**Context** 

Supersig is like multisig but with superpowers. This means that you have some added features such as:

- you can add and remove members from the supersig.
- you get simpleMajority, instead of fixed thresholds. 
- you get a master superuser feature. A master user always has 50% of the voting power. This means that if a master user is involved in a transaction, only one other person needs to sign in order to approve the transaction for execution. (*More than one person can be a master user). 

Supersig is now part of Kabocha parachain's mainnet on Kusama. 

Milestone 1 was about building pallet_supersig's first version. The pallet now allows you to do the abovementioned core functions. 

Milestone 2 was about adding user interface within the "apps" frontend environment. This will be at home in https://apps.decentration.org. 

Milestone 3 was about making some final improvements through user feedback. A portion was set aside for M1 and M2. For M1 an rpc module was added. And for M2 improvements were made making the usability even easier, specifically in relation to viewing and voting on live proposals. 

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
