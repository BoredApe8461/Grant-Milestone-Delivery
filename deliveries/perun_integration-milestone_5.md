**Context**

Perun Channels is a technology enhancing blockchain scalablity and interoperability. We previously developed the [Perun Pallet](https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-pallet), which provides the on-chain logic for Perun Channels on Polkadot.
Our second project is on the integration of the Perun Pallet into the [Go-Perun](https://github.com/perun-network/go-perun) library.
In the focus of the milestone delivered here is the implementation of a CLI application that demonstrates the usage of Perun Channels on Polkadot.
