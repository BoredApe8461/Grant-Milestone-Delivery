**Milestone 2**

In the previous milestone, we successfully implemented dynamic contract generation based on user-selected features. This milestone marks the completion of the wizard's functionality by adding the crucial capability of compiling and deploying contracts to the blockchain (currently Rococo Contracts only). To achieve this, we developed a backend service that handles both contract compilation and deployment tracking. The backend service was built using the robust and scalable Rocket framework, while cargo-contract was utilized for contract compilation. To store the necessary information, including contracts and their deployments, we deployed a MongoDB instance. This approach ensures that the contracts generated by this tool are compiled and deployed to the blockchain, and that users can access and track the status of their deployed contracts through a robust and reliable database system.

**Next Steps**

The completion of this grant marks only the beginning of the Polkadot Contract Wizard's development journey. We are committed to continuously enhancing the functionality and user experience. Our upcoming plans include implementing new features such as the ability to interact with deployed contracts through the wizard's UI, allowing users to edit contracts in the same interface, and adding more contract templates. These features will make it even more versatile and powerful, enabling developers and non developers to quickly and easily create smart contracts for their projects. We are confident that the Contract Wizard has the potential to become an indispensable tool for the community within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. We are excited to continue working on this development and to see how it evolves in the future.
