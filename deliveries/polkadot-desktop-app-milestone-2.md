# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://forms.gle/8Wx7nxtq8fKrsuEz8) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**

* **PR Link:** https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/17
* **Milestone Number:** 2

In this Milestone, we worked on improvements in the following areas:
* Account creation flow
* General look and feel of the application
* Maintaining the Desktop app

During development, we pivoted from the initial plan outlined in the [original spec](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/17). Part of the work we've done was originally planned to be included in Milestone 3. On the other hand, some parts of Milestone 2 deliverables are not yet there, so we propose to move them to updated Milestone 3.

### Other activities

Additionally, the changes introduced in Milestone 1 (Polkadot JS as a Desktop app) are being constantly maintained by our team. Below are PRs made in response to desktop-specific issues and to keep Electron dependencies updated:

* [Show icon in dock on linux](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/3365)
* [Fix IPC communication in Electron account store](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/3952)
* [Electron app housekeeping](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/3958)
* [Remove colon from win path](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/4361)

### New proposed scope of Milestone 3

#### Improve User Experience in Accounts app

In this Milestone we'll tackle usability issues with [Accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts).

Currently, users face following difficulties:
* cannot see at a glance the totals of their balances across all accounts
* account names cannot be edited
* accounts list default sort is not intuitive and cannot be changed by the user
* unlock is not next to the locked balance, but in the drop down menu
* some information provided in the accounts list gives little value to users (eg. type, tags, transactions count) and could be hidden in some detail view
* expanding balances messes up the table layout

For sure coming up with an effective design will require some iterating over wireframes/prototypes, and possibly also with implementations.

Additionally, we'll remove dependencies on SUI library components where possible.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -------| ----------- | ------------- |

| 2.     | Accounts list implementation | Implementing the designs in Polkadot-JS apps |
| 3.     | Accounts sidebar implementation | Implementing the sidebar that pops up after clicking on an account |
| 3.     | Documentation updates | We'll add or update the relevant documentation where needed |
