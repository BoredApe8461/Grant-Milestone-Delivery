| 2. | new approval back-end |[PR](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension/pull/1068)| The old system of whitelist was removed and a new system of authorization per website per account was implemented. Note that the account visibility feature (with the eye) was kept untouched as previously discussed.| 
| 3. | website approval enhancement | [PR](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension/pull/1068) | The parameter screen "Manage Website Access" wasenhanced and users can select per website what accounts are shared with each website. The account selection component was re-used here so as to reduce maintenance hurdle. |
