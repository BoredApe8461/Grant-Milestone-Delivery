**Note**  

* Considering the comments from first milestone delivery we have added below components that where not in scope inorder to bring a utility for this delivery
    * Push Notification
    * Balance Filter
    * Minimal UI for Registering Balance Notification

* Below Components has been scoped out
    * Kafka and Zookeeper Deployment guide - As the deployment is done through Docker Compose and Helm Chart
    * wskdeploy , Event Manager: Intermediate Container as the rust action has to be pre compiled and existing runtime was not compatible we had to customise the runtime for our need. runtime used https://github.com/HugoByte/openwhisk-runtime-rust.
    * Kafka Provider: Helm Chart Configuration as openwhisk helm chart contains the Kafka Provider

**Known Issues**
* Actions might fail if the device has less than 8GB ram
* Connecting to live chain for a long time is not feasible as the Runtime need to be optimized for concurrency
* Push notifications will not be visible if the substrate-push-notification page is on focus. It should either be closed or should be in background after notification registration
