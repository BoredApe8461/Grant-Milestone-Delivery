**Context**

This Milestone contains the very first version of the Prosopo human verification service. Currently, it exists as a command line and API tool only with the frontend UI to be delivered as part of the next Milestone. The purpose of this Milestone has been to implement the backend design, as described in the Grant Application. The `Protocol` smart contract is the backbone of the Prosopo service, making payments between actors and storing data that can be used to resolve disputes. The nodeJS `Provider` service is designed to allow people to offer human verification services, currently in form of captchas, branching out into other formats in the future.

| 0b.  | Documentation | https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/blob/main/README.md | The README files explain how to use each repository. However, the repos are best used together in the integration repository. |

We've created a branch in each of our repositories called `milestone1`. We'd appreciate you using these branches when running the code. | 
| 0d.  | Docker |https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider/blob/master/dev.dockerfile https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/blob/main/docker-compose.yml| A dockerfile exists for the Provider repo. The various repos are pulled together in the `integration` repository, in which a docker compose file spins up 3 containers  - `Provider`, `Substrate`, and `MongoDB`|

**Additional Information**

- Our `Provider` node is currently architected as a series of TypeScript files that will be broken into sensible packages as part of Milestone 2. This is to allow re-use of components.

- We recognise the `Protocol` contract is very long, and we will be migrating it to use [OpenBrush's contract library](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/c71097ff10ef6d187bf9c86f0248bfbc6ec40a3c/docs/docs/smart-contracts) as part of Milestone 2.

- Our original contract design involves checking captcha solutions for users within a timeframe. It has not been possible to unit test this as `block_timestamp` does not exist in the experimental `ink!` unit test engine. We are exploring alternatives for this feature as part of Milestone 2.

As part of this Milestone we contributed PRs and comments to various Polkadot ecosystem projects.
