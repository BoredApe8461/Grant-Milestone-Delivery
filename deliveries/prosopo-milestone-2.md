## Evaluation Plan

Below you will find additional information to make it clear on how to proceed with the evaluation.

### Milestone 2 Branch

### 0a. Licenses

Licenses differ per package. All licenses are either MIT, GPLv3, or Apache License 2.0.

### 0b. Documentation

There is a repository called [client-example](https://github.com/prosopo-io/client-example) that demonstrates how to
integrate the [procaptcha-react](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha-react) package into a React app.
Procaptcha-react is a wrapper of [procaptcha](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha), which is an interface to
the [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) API and the [protocol](https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol)
smart contract. The documentation consists of the READMEs in these repositories. The architecture
is [documented in our proposal](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/prosopo.md#24-architecture)
.

### 0c. Testing Guide

Due to the nature of blockchain development, there was not much we could do in terms of unit tests for the frontend, as
almost every operation depends on either the [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) API or a contract
query/transaction. Therefore, there are minimal unit tests in the [procaptcha](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha)
repository that test the state and context reducers. All other functionality is covered by the integration tests that
are part of the [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider#tests) repository.

### 0d. Docker

The [demo docker file](https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/blob/milestone2/docker-compose.demo.yml) is the most feature
filled docker file we have. It starts a pre-populated substrate node, a mongo db, and
a [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) node running a captcha API. The developer is then expected to run
either [client-example](https://github.com/prosopo-io/client-example#how-to-run-locally)
or [demo-nft-marketplace](https://github.com/prosopo-io/demo-nft-marketplace#how-to-run-locally).

### 0e. Article

https://github.com/prosopo-io/prosopo-website/blob/milestone2/src/articles/prosopo-completes-web3-foundation-grant.md

### 1 Prosopo Client SDK

[procaptcha](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha) is the main package that communicates with
the [provider](https://github.com/prosopo-io/provider) API and the
[protocol](https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol) smart contract. Procaptcha is designed to be used by a user
interface package, such as [procaptcha-react](https://github.com/prosopo-io/procaptcha-react).

### 2 Demo Website

[https://nft.demo.prosopo.io](https://nft.demo.prosopo.io) is a fully fledged NFT marketplace that demonstrates how the
captcha UI works in a website and in a contract simultaneously. The website is protected by a captcha user interface -
the "Select All" images captcha. The PSP34 contract in the background is protected by
the [protocol](https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol) smart contract by using the `is_human` function.

### 3 Integration Scripts

The [developer set up instructions](https://github.com/prosopo-io/integration/tree/develop#development-environment-set-up)
can be used to evaluate the integration repository.
