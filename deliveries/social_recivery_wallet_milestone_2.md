| 1. | Recovery Lookup | The ability to add guardians and an indicator whether that an account has a an active recovery. Note that the active recovery shows on the recovery screen when it exists. When there is no active recovery the UI element does not show. |  
| 2. | Vouch | The ability to vouch for user that has an active recovery requesting signature from the account in the wallet.  |  
| 3. | Claim and Recover | When threshold is met, user will have the ability to claim and recover their tokens.  |  

**Additional Information**

We had to change some screens from the original plan because of intricacies of the recovery we were not aware of. For example, if there is an active proxy, it shows on the recovery screen - this was added because users can actually leave the proxy there for as long as they want. 

We also added all 3 modes of shutting down the recovery - removing an active recovery object; removing the recovery configuraiton from the rescuer side; removing a proxy entry (closes a recovery).
