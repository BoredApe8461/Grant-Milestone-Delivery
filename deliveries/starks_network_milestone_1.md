| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 0a. | License |[Apache License](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE2)| The Starks Node uses the Apache 2.0 license. |
| 0b. | Documentation |[Basic tutorial and documentation](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node/blob/master/README.md)| Documentation on running the Starks node as binary or using docker. Explanation of how the Distaff VM works. A walkthrough on how to interact with the VM using the Starks UI. |
| 0c. | Testing |[test files](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node/tree/master/frame/distaff-vm/src/tests), [doc](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node/blob/master/README.md)| Unit test of the Distaff VM functionalities. |
| 1. | Substrate module: Distaff VM |[Distaff VM pallet](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node/tree/master/frame/distaff-vm), [rpc](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node/tree/master/client/rpc/src/distaff_vm), [rpc-api](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node/tree/master/client/rpc-api/src/distaff_vm)| The Distaff VM has been embedded as a native runtime module in the Substrate node. Related rpc interfaces are added for demo purpose. |
| 2. | Substrate chain |[Starks Node](https://github.com/gbctech/starks-node)| One can clone this repo and run `cargo build --release` to build the binary for the chain. A docker image is also provided (see below). |
| 3. | Docker |[Starks UI](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/starksnetwork/starks-ui), [Starks Node](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/starksnetwork/starks-node)| The docker deliverables contain two parts. The Starks UI is the frontend based on Polkadot-JS. The Starks node is the substrate chain with the Distaff VM. By running both docker containers, one will be able to test stark proof verification using proof data generated by the Distaff VM. |
