* **Milestone Number:** 2


We finished and wrapped everything up as a part of the Milestone 2.

We chose to dedicate a bit more time and effort into development and:
1. Conducted user testing and adapted application based on feedback we received 
2. Reached to the community and asked them what templates would they like to have as a part of our solution
3. We upgraded all the pallets, and the template from ver 2.0.0-rc4 to version 2.0.0 (as we firstly started development when rc4 was the latest version)
Please take a look and be free to send any question you have. Looking forward to your feedback.
