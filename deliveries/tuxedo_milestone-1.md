# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/tuxedo.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**
Tuxedo is a runtime framework for writing Substrate runtimes in the UTXO model. It is analogous (and an alternative) to FRAME which uses the accounts model. This is the first of three milestones in the grant.

In this milestone we have written focused primarily on the on-chain aspects. This includes the **core of the Tuxedo system**, the first and most important "piece" (analogous to a pallet) which we call the **money piece** that represents a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency, several other **example pieces**, and a **template** node and runtime using the Tuxedo system.

We have also put together a minimal PoC "wallet" for spending coins, but this wallet is nowhere near production ready; the real wallet will be developed in milestone two. Similarly, the project's [readme](https://github.com/Off-Narrative-Labs/Tuxedo/#readme) contains instructions to test the code both through unit tests and manually with the PoC wallet, but this is not the final tutorial; a detailed written tutorial and accompanying video tutorial will be developed in milestone 3.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | ... |...| ...| 
| 2.  | ... |...| ...|
