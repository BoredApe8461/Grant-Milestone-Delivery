- Deliverable 0d:
  - We have a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/blob/master/Dockerfile) that is used for building docker image, and also we have a [CI/CD](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml), docker file published on [github packages](https://ghcr.io/727-ventures/typechain-polkadot-ci)
- Deliverable 0e:
  - Article is published on [medium](https://medium.com/brushfam/ways-how-to-use-typechain-polkadot-in-your-project-281ef80b8dd8), it's about how to use typechain-polkadot in your project, it's a very good article that can help users to start with typechain, also it has an example project that you can use to test typechain-polkadot and typechain-compiler
- Deliverable 1:
  - We have a [docs](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/tree/master/packages/typechain-polkadot#plugins), and also we have an example how typechain itself uses plugins, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/blob/master/packages/typechain-polkadot/index.ts), so you can test this deliverable by following the steps in documentation
- Deliverable 2:
  - We have [docs](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/blob/master/docs/about.md#events) & [example](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/blob/master/tests/events/general.test.ts), if something is unclear, we're encouraging you to check [tests directory](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/tree/master/tests/events)
- Deliverable 3:
  - You can test by following steps in the article [typechain-compiler](https://medium.com/brushfam/ways-how-to-use-typechain-polkadot-in-your-project-281ef80b8dd8), it has a lot of information about how to use typechain-compiler, and also it has an example project that you can use to test typechain-compiler 
- Deliverable 4:
  - You can test by running the openbrush unit tests, which use typechain-polkadot
- Deliverable 5: 
  - You can check our [package](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot/tree/master/packages/typechain-types), which contains everything that typechain-polkadot uses as a static code for generated code
