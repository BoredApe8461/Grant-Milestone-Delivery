## Evaluation V5

### Frontend

This time I was able to create a simple collection, a simple NFT, activate the collection, view this NFT in My NFT, and Lock the NFT metadata, without any problem.

### Automated Test

I tested the automated tests again, and this time all passed.

## Evaluation V4


### Documentation

[In this part of the deploying guide](https://docs.alephzero.org/aleph-zero/build/deploying-your-contract-to-aleph-zero-testnet), the instructions recommend using the Polkadot.js to deploy the contracts, but now it seems not to be working because the Polkadot.js doesn't support WeightV2 yet.

### Frontend

I followed [this tesing guide](https://github.com/ArtZero-io/Contracts/blob/feature/ink-4-version/contract_deployment_and_update_addresses_abis.md#cache-data-for-pmp-nft) to get the admin function, this guide is complex, but it works. 

In the frontend, I tested all the features I couldn't test before, but I have some problems, for example, when I tried to activate the collections, I received this error:

![image (12)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112647953/227582457-9394ea09-a4a2-4bcb-9a43-aabddacdd0ad.png)

After a minute the collection became active. When I tried to create a Collection in simple mode the same error appeared but this time no collection was created. Because of that, I couldn't create a simple NFT and lock the metadata. When I tested this function with the previously deployed contracts it was working.

In My Collections, I couldn't find how to edit the royalty percentage. In MY NFT and MY Stakes test are mentioned a page with All NFT and Stakes, but I in the page there is no "All" filter. Are these features still in the project? 


All other features are working fine.

### API

I tried again, and now the requests work fine.

### Code Quality

The warnings from Azero_Contracts were fixed.

### Automated tests

I tried to run the automated tests again and now all of them are failing. Could you assist with that?

## Evaluation V3

I evaluated both frontend and backend using the testnet provided. I still need to test both using a local substrate node. Please provide more detailed instructions for contract deployment and update the contract addresses and abi in the frontend application. Also, provide any config update instructions to point the backend and frontend to a local substrate node instead of the testnet provided. 

I also notice that there are no instructions on how to set the admin profile for testing.

### Backend

In Run Backend Job, needs to change `node az_bids_monitors` to `node az_bids_monitor` to match the name of the file.
The error in Az_events_collector seems to be fixed.

### API 

Some requests returned with success, but with an empty return. Here is a list of the requests:

- getBidsByBidderAddress
- getCollectionsByVolume
- getNFTsByOwnerAndCollection
- getNFTsByCollectionAddress
- getNewListEvents
- getUnlistEvents
- getPurchaseEvents
- getBidWinEvents
- getOwnershipHistory
- getAddRewardHistory
- getClaimRewardHistory

I tried getJSON and getCollectionContract requests using the API page provided and got:

```
TypeError: Windown.fetch: HEAD or GET Request cannot have a body.
```

I put `/ipfs/QmSdgNQ2zvJvaw8kP8oCJnmuFQUxVDBYrThYvV1C8k5bXU/131.json` in the input for getJson and nothing in getCollectionContract.

The other requests work fine.

### Frontend

I tested some features following the test plan.

In the part of Marketplace, I tested the collections creating one inactive collection and an NFT that doesn't appear in My NFTs. Because of that, I couldn't test other features related to NFT, excluding creating and editing the NFT.

In the part of LauchPad, I created a project and tried to update the project info the transaction was complete, but the project wasn't changing. When I tried to Update the art location, the transaction success but I don't view anything changing. I don't find the button Withdraw_Balance and couldn't test Owner mint, Mint an NFT, and Update project phases.

I couldn't test the Admin features, how to log in with admin?

In the MyAccount I haven't tested My NFTs and My Stake and the Mint NFT in My Project.

### Code Quality

`cargo +nightly clippy` in Azero_Contracts now finish to compile but still returning some warnings, for example:

```
...

## Evaluation V2

### Contract

All contracts build without problems and passed all tests.

### Backend

Az_events_collector got this error after some time running during the API testing.

```

### API

API starts, but I only tested the first 5 tests in the testing guide, because 4 of them failed. I used the same inputs in the guide.

UpdateCollection
```
{
    "status": "FAILED",
    "message: "Not Exist Address"
}
```

UpdateAdress
```
{
    "status": "FAILED",
    "message: "Invalid Address"
}
```

newMintingEvent
```
{
    "status": "OK",
    "message: "SUCCESS"
}
```

UpdateNFT
```
{
    "status": "FAILED",
    "message: "Not Exist Address"
}
```

UpdateBids
```
{
    "status": "FAILED",
    "message: "Not Exist Collection Address"
}
```

### Frontend

It starts fine, but when I was testing, I got the error `Could not upload your image!!!.` when trying to create a collection or project. Because of that, I could only test the dashboard and my profile, it works fine.

Some features still use external API `https://api.artzero.io`. The ideal scenario for testing is to run all services locally.

### Code Quality

Problems returned from `cargo +nightly clippy` in Azero_Contracts aren't fixed.

The EsLint in the frontend now returns no problems.

## Evaluation V1


### Backend

Https://github.com/ArtZero-io/backend only have the LICENSE and README.MD, the source code is missing. We need the source code to test the application locally. Furthermore, the source code is a deliverable reported in the grant application.


### Frontend

The frontend ran but it needs the backend to work properly.


### System test

The ideal situation is to run all parts of the system locally for testing. I need a local server (backend) to do the System test of the application.


### Contracts Building and Testing

I built all contracts, however, the proxy contract presented an error.



```

The contract tests seem to be system tests and not unit ones as declared in the grant application. Furthermore, all test scripts fail. Please provide proper configuration or instructions to run these tests. 


The collection_manager_test.ts returned some problems. For example:
