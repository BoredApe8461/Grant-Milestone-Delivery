## Evaluation V1

### Testing Guide

Some files reported [in this link](https://github.com/InkWhale-net/contracts/tree/main/inkwhale_contract/tests) are missing. It's missing **artifacts** folder and the **test_files.ts**.

### Backend

Need a guide on how to run locally to test the application.

### Frontend

Need a guide on how to run. But I ran `npm install` and got:

```
user@localhost:~/Documents/InkWhale- Net/frontend$ npm install

With `npm install --force` and `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` it finished the install.

```

Some issues need review, and may require choosing

```

And with `npm start` I ran the frontend but I need the backend to test the application locally.

### Code Quality

The contracts in inkwhale_contracts are compiling. Some warnings were generated during the compilation as showed below.

```
InkWhale- Net/contracts/lp-pool-generator$ cargo build --release
warning: unused import: SpreadLayout
  --> lib.rs:14:13
   |
14 |             SpreadLayout,

warning: lp_pool_generator (lib) generated 1 warning (run cargo fix --lib -p lp_pool_generator to apply 1 suggestion)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.16s
```

I ran `cargo +nightly clippy` in inkwhale_contracts and got some problems. For example:

```

I ran `npx eslint src` for the frontend and no warnings or error returned.
