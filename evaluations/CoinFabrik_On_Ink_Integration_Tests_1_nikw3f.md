# General Notes

Thank you team for completing this milestone. I've thoroughly reviewed the milestone report submitted for the Ink Integration Tests. I can accept the milestone. Here's my feedback:

- The distinction between integration tests and e2e tests is clearly outlined.
- Itâ€™s commendable that the team went beyond and identified the inconsistencies and provided recommendations on functionalities.
- The identification of functions with the `unimplemented!()` macro is noteworthy. It showcases the team's in-depth analysis of the codebase.
- The proposed approach for Milestone 2 is well-defined, highlighting both implementation and review plans for the identified functions.
- The milestones achieved are commendable, and the roadmap for the next phase looks promising.
