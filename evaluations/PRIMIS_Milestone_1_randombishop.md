## General Notes

There clearly was a great effort put into this first iteration, posing a nice foundation for a desktop wallet app.

The source code is well organized and cleanly written, modulo some typos here and there and a lack of comments and documentation.

All issues reported in this evaluation can be summarized into a documentation bucket, plus some small bugs or features that still need a little bit of polishing.

As I am not calibrated yet to decide which issues are blocking vs ok to move forward, I will defer to a W3F officer to decide how to proceed.
