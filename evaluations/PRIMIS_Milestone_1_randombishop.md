## General Notes

There clearly was a great effort put into this first iteration, posing a nice foundation for a desktop wallet app.

The source code is well organized and cleanly written, modulo some typos here and there and a lack of comments and documentation.

All issues reported in this evaluation can be summarized into a documentation bucket, plus some small bugs or features that still need a little bit of polishing.

As I am not calibrated yet to decide which issues are blocking vs ok to move forward, I will defer to a W3F officer to decide how to proceed.


## Detailed Evaluation

### 0b. Documentation

**Expectation** 
- Inline document of code and tutorial docs that explain how users can install it.

**Assessment**
- Installing from source is straightforward with npm install or yarn install. 
- But yarn didn’t work in my machine.
- Warning: 
```warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json```
- Installing with the provided packages in the website is accessible to any user.
- MAC dmg :check:
- Windows installer TO CHECK
- The code is easy to understand but lacks some high level pointers and comments.

**Recommendation**
- Keep either npm package lock or yarn’s lock file. By having both, it’s unclear which one is the source of truth. I recommend keeping only one and making sure it works in different environments.
- See recommendations about documentation in the following sections of this evaluation.


### 0c. Testing

**Expectation**
- Unit tests will cover all core functions to ensure functionality and viability. We will describe how to run the tests in the tutorial.

**Assessment**
- A manual testing guide is provided as a google spreadsheet:
[doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DccCJUEu7HLUpQYrh6QBfJ1wuRyPeMBWoAsppco-nEU/edit?usp=sharing)
- Running the tests with npm run test fails:
```
Test Suites: 4 failed, 4 total
Tests:       6 failed, 2 passed, 8 total
```

**Recommendation**
- It is generally hard to test front end applications, so I recommend providing a document that explains the testing approach and which modules can be unit tested. This should cover at least the services in `api` folder.
- Move the google spreadsheet to a text file and include it in the GitHub repo so that we can keep track of changes and decentralize contributions.
- Add edge case scenarios to the testing guide. Example: sending a transaction that will fail because of not enough gas or existential deposit issue.
- Add “how to run tests” in the main README file.
