## General Notes

There clearly was a great effort put into this first iteration, posing a nice foundation for a desktop wallet app.

The source code is well organized and cleanly written, modulo some typos here and there and a lack of comments and documentation.

All issues reported in this evaluation can be summarized into a documentation bucket, plus some small bugs or features that still need a little bit of polishing.

As I am not calibrated yet to decide which issues are blocking vs ok to move forward, I will defer to a W3F officer to decide how to proceed.


## Detailed Evaluation

### 0b. Documentation

**Expectation** 
inline document of code and tutorial docs that explain how users can install it.

**Assessment** 
- Installing from source is straightforward with npm install or yarn install. 
- But yarn didn’t work in my machine.
- Warning: 
```warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json```
- Installing with the provided packages in the website is accessible to any user.
- MAC dmg :check:
- Windows installer TO CHECK
- The code is easy to understand but lacks some high level pointers and comments.

**Recommendation**
- Keep either npm package lock or yarn’s lock file. By having both, it’s unclear which one is the source of truth. I recommend keeping only one and making sure it works in different environments.
- See recommendations about documentation in the following sections of this evaluation.
