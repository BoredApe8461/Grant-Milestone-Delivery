## General Notes

Good inline documentation. weights, etc. It would be nice if they could add readmes to the pallets. Only the code for the front-end integration is open source and not the entire front-end, which is according to contract, but not so useful for others.

They [explained why they reused a small part of the compound code](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/186#issuecomment-864762595), which is reasonable. Also they now mention it directly in the readme. Since it was only a small part, the code was already changed quite a lot and not directly part of this delivery, Iâ€™m going to leave it at this.
