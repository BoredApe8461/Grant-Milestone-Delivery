## General Notes

I see that initially you have committed to providing interface for interacting with substrate contracts.
From architecture perspective, you can interact with the contracts in a similar way as your API, Keyring implementation. For more information on how to integrate them, check out this documentation: 
https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api-contract
https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api-contract/start/install
https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api-contract/start/basics
https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api-contract/start/code

### Constructive Feedback:
1. I like the demo application. If you want to further improve it, you can try implementing a reference front-end application something in the style of https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app or https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template which would allow users in the bubble ecosystem to easily start building on top of your features. 
2. Your testing can be automated. Please check Cypress.io or similar frameworks for automation of your testing. 
3. Maybe a small improvement for the keyring in the future... You can add User Management module and show how users can easily manage their keys. The demo is currently too technical for average users.
