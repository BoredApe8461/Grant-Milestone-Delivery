## General Notes


Overall the deliverables are adequately met. The UI is responsive and intuitive, and works well in both desktop and mobile resolutions. 


Additional feedback:

* Search strings with more search results are slower to appear which may become problematic as more on-chain identities are registered. 
* Some (unexpected?) search strings e.g. "*" cause errors in the console and the spinner to spin continously, giving the impression that the website is hanging.
* The detailed identity view could perhaps use the space a bit better for desktop resolutions, and it would be nice to have additional data such as registrar information for judgements included with the default `BasicInfoPlugin.vue`.
