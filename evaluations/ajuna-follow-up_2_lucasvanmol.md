| Number | Deliverable | Accepted | Link | Evaluation Notes |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | ---- |----------------- |
| 0a. | License |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK/blob/main/LICENSE) | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [General Documentation](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/24) | Described as "Ongoing progress". Overall, the combination of documentation + draft video tutorials was sufficient for me for this grant evaluation. More extensive/complete documentation and tutorials focused towards users of the upcoming Unity SDK is planned for M3/M4, and will be a great help for user onboarding imo. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Unit-test coverage & Guide](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/25) | Ajuna.SDK auto-generates tests for it's components. The generated tests seem functional, however coverage is a little low (<50% for Ajuna.NetApiExt) using the [Fine Code Coverage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FortuneNgwenya.FineCodeCoverage) tool. Since the code is autogenerated, and everything else seems to work, I'm willing to accept this level of coverage but it could be nice to improve in the future. |
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Article or Tutorial](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/26) | The draft video tutorials are useful, and are a good basis for what's planned for M3/M4. My advice would also be to have a video/article/documentation that gives a bigger overview of Ajuna, and how each of the different parts work and interact with each other - essentially a more detailed explanation of [this graph](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/29#issuecomment-1173754559).  |
| 1. | Pallet |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Scheduled Events & Matchmaker](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/28) | Works, tests are good. |  
| 2. | Game Engine |
| 2a. | Game Engine |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Concept game engine and architecture](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/29) | |
| 2b. | Game Engine |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Account, Player, Wallet, Mnemonic](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/30) | Auto-generated by [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK) |
| 2c. | Game Engine |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Asset Transfer, Buy/Sell, Auction](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/31) | Auto-generated by [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK) |
| 2d. | Game Engine |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [GameEventSystem](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/32) | Now supported by `pallet-matchmaker`, where again the Ajuna.SDK can generate C# bindings to. |
| 2e. | Game Engine |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Subscription/Event Service](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/33) | Works |
| 2f. | Game Engine |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Custom Game Logic layer](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/34) | Custom game logic can be implemented by developing a pallet and using the Ajuna.SDK to generate bindings for it in C#. A framework for building turn-based board-like games was built (see examples in `ajuna-board` in 2a). |
| 3. | Service Layer |
| 3a. | Service Layer |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Concept and Artefacts](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/35) | Implemented by [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK), which reads metadata from a websocket endpoint and automatically generates code to allow interfaceing with the node's extrinsics using C# code (see deliverable 7). |
| 3b. | Service Layer |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Global storage access](https://github.com/JetonNetwork/JtonNetwork.ServiceLayer/pull/1) | Auto-generated by [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK) | 
| 3c. | Service Layer |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [All Pallets](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/37) | Auto-generated by [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK) | 
| 3d. | Service Layer |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Persistence layer](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/38) | Additional tutorial regarding this functionality was added on request. | 
| 3e. | Service Layer |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Event Triggers](https://github.com/ajuna-network/SubstrateNET.UnityDemo/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/MenuController.cs) |  |
| 4. | Rest API |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Rest API](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/40) | Auto-generated by [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK), works. |
| 5. | Basic Bot |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Plays DOT4G](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/41) | Bots are able to queue for a match on chain and then find and play a match with each other. |
| 6. | Tutorial |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Tutorials](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/42) | See 0d.|
| 7. | Generator |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK) | Initially running (now unsupported) .NET 5, but the team was quick to update the SDK and target .NET 6 instead. Generating the files works, and generated tests are working |
| 7a. | MetaData |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Metadata](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.NetApi/blob/031942faa11c49eb7cfb0a589422539bb6ad42f3/Ajuna.NetApi/SubstrateClient.cs#L73) | This step was found to not be needed anymore (see delivery) |
| 7b. | Generator |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Ajuna.NetApiExt Generator, including all Types](https://github.com/ajuna-network/SubstrateNET/tree/master/SubstrateNET.NetApi/Generated/Model) | |
| 7c. | Generator |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Storage Generator, including all Pallets](https://github.com/ajuna-network/SubstrateNET/tree/master/SubstrateNET.NetApi/Generated/Model) | |

## General Notes

Thanks for this delivery, and the changes & support you've already offered on Matrix. I think the Ajuna.SDK you created as part of this grant is really cool and could also have many uses outside of its application here. 

The team also had a great answer to the question I had about the general structure of the application as a whole which you can read here: https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/498#issuecomment-1193126112
