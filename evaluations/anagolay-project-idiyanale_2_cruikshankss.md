# Additional Notes

I am accepting your Milestone 2. Thank you for and congratulations on the successful completion of the w3f grant portion of your Idiyanale project. 

I’m impressed to have reviewed the additional work you’ve completed so far with Idiyanale towards realizing so many general web 3.0 technology stack ideals. 

To begin, thank you for teaching me more about the general blockchain ideal of being a massive ledger with IPFS as the file system. You have successfully built many tools and open-source public infrastructure to make the IPFS more usable. 

Here are more of the web3 tech stack ideals & what you’ve built:

Utilize the Web APIs (existing public web standards)
- WebSockets: built a secure IPFS public gateway on port 8080 
- Wasm: simplified complexity by going into the browser machine rather than building layers of complexity on top of it (your Node.js module)
- Wasm: built Manifests as deterministic config files (more ideal than cargo.toml and package.json concerning determinism)
- Wasm: built Workflows as essentially simplified & generic web “functions” (input → process → output) where input can even be a buffer

Security ideals (mathematically cryptographic, 18 CIS, etc.):
- You took the extra time & resources to build Manifests in a way to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (MitM)
- You have the ability to create six different types of CID including four types of wasm cryptographic hashing (I believe?) and maintain compatibility with the IPFS CID standard
- You have created the substrate Workflow pallet which takes advantage of built-in substrate Layer 0 security 

Ideals regarding the non-technical end-user
- You idealize pushing IPFS to a high durability (at least 11 9s) which you mentioned only AWS and one other is able to currently achieve 
- Secure copyright & ownership (you north star is this Layer 3 or 4 use case, which is why you’ve been building Layer 0 ideals)
- Processing data is energy-efficient/high speed: ideal for the environment, user experience, and ideal cost (internationalization/scalable for business)
- You have built an attractive UI for using Workflows/IPFS for rapid, distributed image processing which is a use-case for copyright and ownership

More ideals relating to the substrate/Polkadot/Kusama/Rococo/w3f, etc. ecosystem:
- Your Workflow pallet enables you to potentially become a parachain
- You’ve built benchmarking/pallet weight calculations
- You’ve built rust code generation to aid devs, which is the preferred memory-safe language of choice in the ecosystem, but also utilize JavaScript which is the preferred frontend language in the ecosystem
- You build with a general polychain vision as well as a Layer 0 mindset to fix what’s broken with the web and ideally truly create sustainable solutions 
- Notably, it seems you have solved determinism and the ability to use substrate as a dependency using IPFS, which could potentially solve the massive versioning/dependency issues with Rust toolchains/cargo builds/docker/substrate nodes with your Idiyinale wasm/Manifest/Workflow system (and I suggest you apply for Treasury funding for runway to maintain this codebase)

Additional ideals/notes 
- You utilize gitpod to enable devs to have a dependable dev environment
- You’ve done important compiler work for your Publish service, although I can’t remember the details
- You have built a CLI to enhance developer experience (DX)
- Excellent documentation/testing guide/articles on Medium/GitHub repo READMEs, etc.
