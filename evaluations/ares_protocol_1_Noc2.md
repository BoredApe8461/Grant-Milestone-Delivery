 0 | Apache | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul> | [license](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/blob/master/LICENSE) |  Initially no license, they added the Apache License |
| 1. | oracle pallet |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [pallet](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/blob/main/substrate-node-template/pallets/pallet-ares/src/lib.rs) | works and they keep improving it. Some of the tests didn't work, but it was fixed |
| 2. | scanner |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [index.js](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/blob/main/fetch-data/index.js) | very basic js based scanner |
| 3. | provider |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [pallet-ocw](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/blob/main/substrate-node-template/pallets/pallet-ocw/src/lib.rs), [aggregate-ares](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/tree/main/aggregate-ares) | originally implemented in java, added off-chain worker solution | 
| 4. | Testing |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [tests](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/blob/main/substrate-node-template/pallets/pallet-ares/src/tests.rs) | unit tests, but initially unused imports and no documentation |
| 5. | example for demonstration |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [fetch-data](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/tree/main/fetch-data) | The example doesn't use "golang implement scanner and provider". Contract needs to be amended |
| 6. | Documentation |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [readme](	https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/blob/main/README.md), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6q8R5F7abM&t=2s), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlYhsHFKzJw) | Initially the documentation was missing a lot of information, but they improved it and added two videos to it  |

## General Notes

Contract was [amended](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/176). 

Initially no use of any off-chain worker, but it was [integrated](https://github.com/aresprotocols/ares-module/blob/main/substrate-node-template/pallets/pallet-ocw/src/lib.rs). They also included a front-end and provided videos. The overall quality of the code and documentation wasnâ€™t very good initially, but they clearly keep working on it and improving it. However, cargo clippy for example still complaints about a lot of things.
