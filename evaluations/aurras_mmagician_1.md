## General Notes

As noted in the [discussion](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/100#issuecomment-783440288), the project structure might seem a little daunting at first, given that it's split across multiple repos. This was made slightly easier to understand by inclusion of extra explanations in the docs when requested.

Similar situation with regards to the docker setup.
For clarity: this is not a strictly negative feedback, but rather an opinionated comment - in the end the structure is decided by the creator who knows best what the users need. The team was able to defend their design choices well, see the [thread here](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/100#issuecomment-783608252).

The process of communicating with the team was good & their way of approaching my comments very well organised and professional: for each request they created an issue, which was followed by a targeted PR when ready.

On the not-so-good side of dev practices was the inclusion of binaries in the source code, rather than having clear instructions on how to build these. This was addressed promptly.

Initially, the instructions on how to build & run the code were incomplete and builds were failing. Again, these were addressed promptly.

At this development stage (M1), there isn't much useful functionality yet, so it's hard to judge the big picture.
