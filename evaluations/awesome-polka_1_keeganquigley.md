# General Notes

Site is built with Vercel and pretty straight forward to navigate. It is a good proof of concept but right now links to just our blogs and wiki pages. Not much information in any of the categories. I hope to see a lot more information added in the future. Hopefully this will change as people sign up to contribute posts.

Please address issues below:

1. As far as I can tell, Awesome Polka is not available on the iOS app store or the Google Play store. The icons just point back to the domain. Is there a reason these are included when the mobile versions haven't been created yet?

2. I'm able to log into the dashboard to modify the contents, however these categories don't exist on the site even though they say "published". Therefore I can't see my changes reflected. Shouldn't I be able to see these categories on the site? (i.e. FAQ, Team, Jobs, etc.)

3. When trying to create an article, selecting "Cancel changes" and "Update" does nothing. I am also unable to upload a cover photo. Are these buttons supposed to work?
