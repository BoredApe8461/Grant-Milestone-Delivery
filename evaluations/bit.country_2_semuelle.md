| 0c. | Testing Guide | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul> | link | The code will have proper unit-test coverage for pallets. |
| 1. | Substrate module: Continuum | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul> | link | This pallet handles the Continuum protocols for shaping the map of the bit countries. |
| 1a. | Spot Good Neighbor (Auction) Protocol | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul> | link | Controls which users are able to participate in auctions for spots, allows existing neighboring spots to have their say on a potential occupier of the new spot. |

| 7. | Connected to Rococo | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul> | link | Become a parachain on Rococo, requires frequent migrations to the newest version of pallets and reapplication for the parachain. Aim to be included as soon as possible. |
| 8. | Local NFT Market | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul> | link | Develop the local bit country marketplace (like a subset of the platform-wide marketplace) for local market and value creation.
