"help developers interact with libraries by simply connecting nodes in realtime"
Blackprint Engine ÃŸ
cable connections,

 execute exported JSON of node, cable connections, and embedded data.

Blackprint conceptually designs software like hardware (with "cable connections") in their no-code app. 

> Blackprint hopefully can help the development of Metaverse, frontend development, as well as automation such as bots that connect to multiple blockchains. Blackprint itself is planning to expand to support several programming languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Golang, and Python. But this proposal is currently only for JavaScript as Blackprint is still trying to improve.

Technology stack
JavaScript (Browser & Node.js)
Polkadot.js's library
Blackprint does have 2 main component:
Engine: Designed for managing data flow between nodes and can be run on Browser/Node.js/Deno
Sketch: Can be used for creating node editor and modify node connections
Blackprint Editor: An IDE that combine the sketch and the engine and provide another tools on the GUI to make the development more easier
