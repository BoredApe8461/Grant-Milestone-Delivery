## General Notes
Sadly in the app at the time of delivery the explorer for Polkadot has stopped tracking new extrinsics on the 21. of December. [time of delivery instance](https://46dc40bb.calamar.pages.dev/polkadot/blocks).

## Readme
The Readme is precise and coherent. Straight forward instructions on how to run this project.

## Article
The article consist of a small description and images for each of the new features. This satisfies the spec agreed upon. It would be nice to have more in depth information about the new features. E.g. explain limitations of features or why these are necessary or helpful. Maybe explain why it is "crucial to have access to the latest metadata documentation" in a block explorer.

## Show related runtime metadata in item's detail
Since Spec 100001 of Polkadot: For every item there is a popup with additional information as expected. In a lot of cases this is pretty unhelpful as it is just another documentation link from the extrinsic to a pallet. The button "click to view more" doesn't forward to more information. I think this should be improved as this is a major item combined with the metadata explorer of this grant. Though maintaining this feature for every network's metadata is outside of the scope of this grant. This doesn't hinder the grant from approval.

Works well for previous specs though. 

## building and testing output

``` $ npm install

npm WARN deprecated svgo@1.3.2: This SVGO version is no longer supported. Upgrade to v2.x.x.

changed 409 packages, and audited 2297 packages in 16m

352 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

24 vulnerabilities (9 moderate, 13 high, 2 critical)
```
Whats the reason to have kept critical vulnerabilies?
- Grantee clarified those vulnerabilites are in dependencies of react.

## trying to run locally and run e2e tests as described in the readme
After removing the package-lock and reinstalling all packages I was able to run it locally. The Docker image works flawlessly.
All 174 e2e tests have passed. The instructions in the readme are good.

```
% npm run test                          

> calamar@0.1.0 test
> playwright test


Running 174 tests using 1 worker
  174 passed (4.3m)
```

## Summary
I see this as 'Accepted'
