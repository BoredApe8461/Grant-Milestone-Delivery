## General Notes

Initially a few smaller issues, but everything was fixed. Also you could argue that the first delivery was already according to the contract. However, the pallet itself, the documentation and the weights can probably still be improved. 

**29.04.22:**

 The documentation on the benchmarks still mentions the template: https://github.com/CESSProject/data-store-pallet/blob/a552b78abfad0a4d6c81968731df611add1c4c66/pallets/data-store/src/benchmarking.rs#L1 and cargo test --release shows zero tests for pallet_data_store, but also runs the 6 tests for pallet_data_store-81554982bd3a900a. Additionally there seems no limit for new new_keywords (at least no error message) and the weight edit is constant (see https://github.com/CESSProject/data-store-pallet/blob/main/pallets/data-store/src/lib.rs#L193).
