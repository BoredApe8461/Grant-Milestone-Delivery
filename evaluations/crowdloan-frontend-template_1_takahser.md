## General Notes

Summarizes the overall performance plus additional feedback/comments

- ~~I'm not sure if "Parity Template" is a good name here. A more suitable name might include "Crowdloan" or "Parachain" or related concepts, rather than a company name.~~ renamed to [crowdloan-template](https://github.com/10clouds/crowdloan-template)

- ~~I don't think the timer should become negative, once the target date is met:~~ fixed

    (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kBs after minification. Consider:
    - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
    - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
    - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
