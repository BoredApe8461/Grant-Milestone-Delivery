# General Notes

I was able to build and run the node both manually and via Docker. Thanks for such detailed instructions! Regarding the test guide, I could:

- Start a DAO
```rust
{
  creator: 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
  startBlock: 114
  daoAccountId: 5EYCAe5gXPgoV2W3s4EjZg3E96qDSpthV951dmqeQjZfXxmF
  purpose: test
  metaData: {desc:test}
  status: Active
}
```

- Create an asset
```rust
{
  owner: 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
  metadata: {
    name: mytoken
    symbol: ME
    decimals: 100
  }
}
```
- Create guilds:
```rust
[
  {
    creator: 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
    startBlock: 114
    name: core team
    desc: 
    metaData: {}
    status: Active
  }
  {
    creator: 5EYCAe5gXPgoV2W3s4EjZg3E96qDSpthV951dmqeQjZfXxmF
    startBlock: 204
    name: rust
    desc: desc
    metaData: {}
    status: Active
  }
]
```
I had trouble after that:
- Apply funds for project with sudo:

- I also had trouble with creating a task:
<img width="327" alt="403" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35080151/223849119-239d95c6-8fcb-4b18-8499-7fe2b83088d3.png">

- When "joining the project task as reviewer" it gives an invalid error, probably because the task doesn't exist.

## V2

Thanks for the changes in the testing guide, I was able to successfully test and complete all module examples.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests all pass.
