## General Notes v1 - Jan 18, 2023
Overall the delivery is decent. It consists of a pallet that enables on-chain invoicing with three parameters: `receiver`, `amount` and `message`;

These are my considerations:

### 0a. License
You wrote “Apache License” in the delivery document, but actually you used “The Unlicense”. This is not a problem, just wanted you to confirm this.

### 0b. Documentation & Tutorial / 0c. Tests
1. For the local setup, I had a minor problem with the rust toolchain, and these two commands worked for me:

    ```bash
    rustup override set nightly-2022-07-28
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```
    Could you put these in the README?
2. It would be cool to add the docs inside the README and not in a separate file (Google Docs), just to make things quicker for developers.

### 0e. Benchmarking
Would it be possible to add some notes about it in the README, and explain how to get the benchmark values?
