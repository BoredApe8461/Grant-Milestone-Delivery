## General Notes

Initially the project wasn’t publicly updated since october 2021! Documentation, Testing Guide and Article initially only for milestone 1 and 2. It took them quite a while to fix everything. But now it’s working again and according to the contract. 

**09.05.22:**

Small issue with the [devDependencies in package.json](https://github.com/Delmonicos/user-frontend/pull/2/files), but the user front-end compiles now.  

**31.03.22:** They added a new testing guide

**Admin/User Front-end Error 04.04.22**
