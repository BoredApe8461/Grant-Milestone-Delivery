## General Notes
Initially very limited unit tests - and only minimal improvement (poor coverage) after requesting more.

Poor & hard to follow documentation, it was hard to grasp how the different components (Oracle, Collector etc.) interact with one another.
I needed multiple follow-ups with the team to get something (more) useful for the community.

The core of the delivery (logic in Rust) was OK.

No follow-up grants.
