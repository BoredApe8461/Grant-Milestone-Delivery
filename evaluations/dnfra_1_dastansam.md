| **0a.** | License | Link | Apache 2.0 |
| **0b.** | Documentation | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1#about-dinfra) [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1/packages/acs-reactor#reference-implementation-chain-reactor) | We delivered module markdown documentation, **inline documentation** of the code and a testing **tutorial** as well as how to implement a Chain Reactor. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1#testing-guide) [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/pipelines/951071017) | Delivered unit tests, CD pipelines, to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| **0d.** | Docker | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1#test-run-of-the-system) [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/blob/MILESTONE1/docker-compose.yml) | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Chain Reactor API | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1#available-playgrounds) [API UI](http://localhost:7300/dinfra)| We created the API for Chain Reactors using OpenAPI,  we integrated a client generator, Python and Javascript clients are generated. |
| 2. | Chain Reactor RI | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1/packages/acs-reactor#reference-implementation-chain-reactor) | We created a Chain Reactor Reference Implementation based on Apache CloudStack that can run against the Apache CloudStack Simulator to facilitate further development. The RI uses Ansible as automation stack|
| 3. | Chain Reactor RI Test Suite | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1/packages/acs-reactor#test-toolkit) | We will released a set of unit tests and a SIMULATOR that can run tests scripts against the Chain Reactor |
| 4. | CD/CI Chain Reactor RI | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/jobs/4774377657) [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/blob/MILESTONE1/.gitlab-ci.yml?ref_type=tags) | Gitlab Pipelines were created for Chain Reactor, based on the SIMULATOR |
| 5. | SSH Key Derivation | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1/packages/keytool?ref_type=tags#wip-dinfra-keytool) | We researched viability of key portability between Substrate and SSH with ed25519. Despite the API providing PKCS8 encoding we did not find portability between NodeJS and OpenSSL Keys.|
| 6. | Substrate Deployment Descriptors | [Link](https://gitlab.com/dinfra/dinfra/-/tree/MILESTONE1/descriptors?ref_type=tags#deployment-descriptors) | A comprehensive guide to deployment descriptors, the usage of JSON Schemas and use cases relevant to the Substrate community.|
