## General Notes

**Update 19.04.22:**

Everything works now according to the contract. However, the UI certainly still can be improved. For example the logout/login feature didn’t work for me and I had to recreate the same multisig. 

**Update 12.04.22:**
- They fixed the previous issues (except snyk), but I'm unable to confirm the transaction via the UI 
- The testing guide needs to be updated: https://github.com/DoraFactory/dorafactory-multisig/blob/main/docs/test-guide.md 

**Initial comments:**
- The font family looked a little bit strange on my Mac with Brave. 
- I wasn’t able to click on cancel during step 2 or back during step 3 
- Doesn’t let you add additional wallets via the extension (+ Add another owner) 

**Snyk test:**
