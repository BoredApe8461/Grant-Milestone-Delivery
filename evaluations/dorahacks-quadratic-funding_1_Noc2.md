They also added a small "testing guide". |

Also start_round function wasn't implemented, the size limit of name as well support for multiple rounds, but the team fixed it. However it's still difficult to follow the code, but given the amount they receive for the milestone it's acceptable |

## General Notes

It’s implementation of GitCoin's approach (see BSC Grant Round-1 https://hackerlink.io/en/Grant/BSC/Round/1/detail) and the algorithm follows Vitalik's original paper (https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html). The initial delivery wasn’t perfect, but the team continuously improved it. Additionally the team deployed a live version of the project: wss://dao.tophacker.com. Given the size of the grant the delivery is accepted.
