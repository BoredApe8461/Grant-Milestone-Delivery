## General Notes

**The team doesn’t get paid for this delivery. The code isn’t fully open source (black-box testing).** It’s a closed source UI for the work, which they did as part of milestone 1. 

The UI works now, but there are a lot of smaller issues and it definitely needs to be further improved before it can be used in production.
