**Update June 8, 2021**: 
- issue with chromium on ubuntu was fixed 
- Metadata issue was fixed
- Fixed all except one issue found by snyk (Denial of Service [Medium Severity][https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEFETCH-674311] in node-fetch@1.7.3, introduced by umi-request@1.3.9 > isomorphic-fetch@2.2.1 > node-fetch@1.7.3, This issue was fixed in versions: 2.6.1, 3.0.0-beta.9)

It’s nice to see that the team fixed almost everything, which I mentioned previously, instead of just focusing on getting the milestone signed off. They are clearly motivated. The design of the UI certainly can still be improved, but given that this was only the first milestone, they did really good work. 

**Initial Feedback on May 27, 2021**: 

- I had issues because I tried to open polkadot.js/apps with doter as well as the polkadot.js extension installed.
- Updating the metadata with polkadot.js/apps doesn't seem to work (entering the password doesn't work)
- The google chrome store version (v1.0.0) as well as the github version (1.0.2) currently don't work with chromium on Ubuntu (extremely small image). 
- Passwords are marked as strong even if I only use letters and numbers.  
- But when I tried to transfer all of my funds inside the wallet back to another address. It told me “success”, but it actually didn't send any of my funds ([see](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/5244101))
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) test see below
