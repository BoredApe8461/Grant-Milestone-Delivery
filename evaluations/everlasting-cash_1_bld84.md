## General Notes

Overall the implementation is easy to understand and clean. The code has some comments that can be removed and the testing coverage should be improved. Specially I suggest to add tests for the ELC Supply Expansion mechanism and the ELC Supply Contraction.

I am having problems running the ELP-Runtime-Node, so I couldn't deploy and run the tests. I suggest to set all the environment into a Docker machine to be sure that we can run the tests easily.

The whitepaper is well explained but there is some space for improvement adding some diagrams explaining the ELC protocol and adding a "References" section. Also there are some minor mistakes with the format PDF format.

Ont the other hand the authors are using the Exchange smart contract from [Patractlabs/store-contracts](https://github.com/patractlabs/store-contracts) at [contracts/pool/Cargo.toml](https://github.com/CycanTech/ELC/blob/main/contracts/pool/Cargo.toml) line 21. The attribution of the authority is in the testing guide and maybe it should be moved to the README.
