### Manual Testing

Could you provide a manual testing guide that shows the usage of the new features?

I tested the software even without this manual. I could create a DAO, a proposal and vote for this proposal. Do I need to wait until the end of the timer to close the proposal? How do I report the proposal using the frontend? Can I change the proposal duration and cust using the frontend? When I tried to use some commands, for example, `faultProposal` from votes in substrate using the account that created the DAO, I received the  "vote.SenderIsNotDaoOwner" error.

### Code Quality

I ran `yarn lint` and didn't receive warnings.

```
user@localhost:~/Documents/genesisdao/genesis-dao-frontend$ yarn lint
yarn run v1.22.19
$ next lint
info  - Loaded env from /home/user/Documents/genesisdao/genesis-dao-frontend/.env
âœ” No ESLint warnings or errors
Done in 2.42s.
```
 
I ran `cargo tarpaulin` to check the coverage of the pallet dao-votes, the coverage could be improved, but it isn't mandatory.
