## General Notes

### 1. License
Ok.

### 2. User Documentation / Testing guide:
In the build contract step, I needed to add nightly builds to my runtime env. Maybe this should be warned to the user because is not the default runtime env:

`rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

I also got a problem with the version of binaryen since with the command suggested “apt-get install binaryen” the version installed was 91 and the required is 99. I needed to install it manually, so it would be better to suggest this way of installing in the manual, download from the link below and add wasm-opt executable path to the PATH variable:

`https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases`

Ok. Improved in the documentation.


### 3. Automated Testing:

```running 5 tests
test erc721::tests::base_uri_works ... ok
test erc721::tests::mint ... ok
test erc721::tests::burn ... ok
test erc721::tests::approve_and_transfer ... ok
test erc721::tests::register_public_keys ... ok

test result: ok. 5 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.05s
```

Comments about testing coverage:

94.96% coverage, 264/278 lines covered.

total_supply function not covered (now covered).

Error handling paths not covered.

Ok. Coverage increased to 96.58% (+1.61%).


### 4. Static Analysis
`cargo +nightly clippy`

`warning: erc721 (lib) generated 46 warnings`

Please look into the warnings and decide which makes sense to fix. You can also use the command below to fix them automatically:

`cargo +nightly clippy –fix`

Ok. Some of them fixed.

### 5. Scripts

All ran ok.

### 6. Code documentation.
It has a file header documentation and a single comment for each method. Would be better if it has method parameters and also return values documentation. I was not able to generate methods documentation with cargo doc. 

Ok. Improved.

### 7. Other.

 The M1 specification mentions those methods: Approval, ApprovalForAll, clear_approval, and set_approval_for_all. However the methods ApprovalForAll and set_approval_for_all don’t seem to be present in the code. Could you please explain the reason for that?

Just one doubt, the solution proposed relies on a relayer to send transactions. How this could affect the overall solution proposed? In practice, would be a single centralized relayer or a decentralized (or multiple) one?

Ok. Answered.
