## General Notes

### Documentation

Docs were somewhat improved upon request. Great job on inline comments.

### Testing Guide

1. Ran into issue with `substrate-greenlemon-node` where my mac wouldn't recognize the unix executable file. 
<br>UPDATE: release was fixed by adding new .zip file.

2. Ran into Zokrates compatibility issue:
```rust
sh ./circuits/build.sh
Compiling withdraw.zok

Compilation failed:

withdraw.zok:7:35
	Visibility modifiers on arguments are only allowed on the entrypoint function

withdraw.zok:7:55
	Visibility modifiers on arguments are only allowed on the entrypoint function

withdraw.zok:7:94
	Visibility modifiers on arguments are only allowed on the entrypoint function
mv: abi.json: No such file or directory
mv: rename out to ../build/out: No such file or directory
```
UPDATE: Issue fixed.

3. Every time there is a system change (such as a reboot) I have to re-add Zokrates to my path with `export PATH=$PATH:/Users/keeganquigley/.zokrates/bin`; I would suggest adding this to the testing instructions, otherwise the scripts will fail.

UPDATE: Issue fixed.

4. Unit tests are successful for all functions, however I noticed that there isn't one for `transfer_from` in the `ERC721` contract. Consider adding it if it makes sense.

UPDATE: Issue explained/fixed.

5. Minor improvement suggestion for Step 2: take out "baseUri" so that it's clear that just the string needs to be entered:
```rust
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreenLemonProtocol/assets/main/nft
```
UPDATE: fixed.
### Scripts

All js scripts run successfully. Index service starts successfully.

## Contracts

`cargo +nightly clippy` generates quite a few warnings for each of the contracts. Please take a look at these to see which ones make sense to fix. You can also use the command below to attempt to fix them automatically:

`cargo doc --open` works to generate all HTML docs.

`cargo +nightly clippy â€“fix`

UPDATE: cargo warnings fixed.

### Relayer

`Deposit`, `RegisterPublicKeys`, `Withdrawal`, `Execute` functions all work manually and with automated tests.

### Verifier

`verify` function works manually and with automated tests.

### ERC721

`mint`, `burn`, `transfer`, `approve` functions all work manually and with automated tests.

**Please note:** No security audits have been conducted as part of this evaluation.
