## General Notes

### Tests

Flipper contract fails to compile under +stable toolchain with following errors:
```rust
Compiling flipper v0.1.0 (/private/var/folders/6_/b7tdvp0d6h779ktj0h92w5km0000gn/T/cargo-contract_nrd4F6)

```
Running `cargo test` on the PSP22 contract results in the following error:
```rust
error[E0554]: `#![feature]` may not be used on the stable release channel
  --> /Users/keeganquigley/.cargo/git/checkouts/openbrush-contracts-4c291f7aab99c37d/14ff655/contracts/src/lib.rs:23:1

```
Running `cargo contract build` on PSP22 results in a lot of these identical errors:
```rust
::impls::ManualKey<1117114132_u32>` in future versions
   = note: upstream crates may add a new impl of trait `parity_scale_codec::WrapperTypeDecode` for type `std::option::Option<()>` in future versions
   = note: upstream crates may add a new impl of trait `parity_scale_codec::WrapperTypeDecode` for type `std::option::Option<()>` in future versions

   = note: upstream crates may add a new impl of trait `parity_scale_codec::WrapperTypeEncode` for type `std::option::Option<()>` in future versions
```
While trying it with the +nightly toolchain results in this common error:
```rust
cargo +nightly contract build
ERROR: Mismatching versions of `parity-scale-codec` were found!
Please ensure that your contract and your ink! dependencies use a compatible version of this package.
```
**UPDATE:** All issues resolved.
