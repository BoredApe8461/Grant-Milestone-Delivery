# Additional Notes

Congratulations on getting multiple ink! contracts deployed locally to add data space functionality and seeing the extrinsics in the polkadot explorer of your locally-running chain. 

Interesting to see how you use:
- minting assets to control initial ownership and access rights
- a locking function to allow downloadable access to the data
- rule executor smart contract for controlling the number of times an asset is accessible 

Nice continuation of your full-stack substrate-based React dapp by adding data spaces functionality. The notification system seems to work well for minting, etc. and I can see how you're looking ahead to the SDK for providing access to Iris nodes. 

I am understanding your architecture evolution now since your last grant. I see how your substrate-based Iris node contains the pallets required for basic functionality and how you envision the future of users interacting with Iris mainly through smart contracts (via the irisEjection chain-extension pallet). I'm looking forward to your `go-ipfs` storage implementation in subsequent milestone(s).
