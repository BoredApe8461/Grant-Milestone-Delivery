Ideally all links inside the above table should include the commit hash,
which was used for testing the delivery. It should also be checked if the software is published under the correct open-source license.

## General Notes

The delivery included a well-detailed analysis and implementation plan for incorporating ISO-8583 into a (potentially Substrate-based) blockchain architecture. Challenges related to security, reversibility, and authorization have been documented thoroughly and solutions have been presented.
