# General Notes

In general the wallet has a very MetaMask like feel and is easy to use. I'm unable to test out XCM functionality due to not being able to transfer between testnets (Rococo, Westend). Would be nice if this could be implemented.

Right now the main display only shows the dollar conversion amount. Just a suggestion for an added feature might be the ability to switch it to show the underlying currency instead.

The wallet works great for both SS58 and EVM accounts, and all features have been delivered. I can easily perform all actions in the guide and the wallet is more robust than many I've seen. Great work!
