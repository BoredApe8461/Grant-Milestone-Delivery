## General Notes

The original contract was [amended](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/commit/1aebbf9680aab2fdf2476e689debd974a1d884b3). 

The test coverage and inline documentation could be improved. In its current stage data is provided via off-chain worker, but there is no verification or anything similar (not part of this milestone). Also probably too much data is put on-chain. The initial delivery had some issues, but everything was fixed.
