Ideally all links inside the above table should include the commit hash,
which was used for testing the delivery. It should also be checked if the software is published under the correct open-source license.

## General Notes

- the delivery was smoke tested using the Liberland-specific frontend instead of the polkadotJs apps because the latter didn't correctly support all features, since the liberland node uses two seperate native currencies - a use case that is not covered by polkadotJs apps
- it might be helpful to open a github issue [in their repository](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/issues)
- the Liberland pallets are located in the [`/frame` directory](https://github.com/liberland/liberland_substrate/tree/863e4d86cb027a999777f3948adf0abb59ae749a/frame) in their repository which I personally found a bit confusing, since [FRAME pallets](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/frame-pallets/#parachain-pallets) are actually a collection of pre-built pallets maintained by the Substrate community, rather than very specific pallets as it's the case for the Liberland pallets.
- Overall, the code and documentation quality of the most recent delivery is much better than the first version that was submitted previously. The team was communicating very proactively regarding their plans and progress on the issues that were found both during earlier evaluation rounds as well as by themselves.

### Documentation Feedback

- ~~There is room for improvement regarding inline comments, both qualitative and quantitative. For example, there are a lot of `TODO`, `FIXME` and `change me` comments and commented legacy code.~~ Update: Lots of said comments have been addressed, there are still a few around, but at an acceptable level.
- ~~Also, lots of fields and functions have only sparse or even no comments at all. Feel free to add more comments here. The parity pallets that you're using as part of the same repo are a good starting point, if you're looking for inspiration on how much and comprehensive the documentation should be.~~ Update: this has been improved on as well, codebase has matured overall since the last review.
- ~~Keep in mind that good code should document itself as well. This includes appropriate naming of the concepts, a piece of code encapsulates. For example, I was confused to see two separate methods `createllm` and `create_llm` in the llm pallet's code, where the first internally calles the latter:~~ The affected code was improved
- ~~The [docs](https://liberland.github.io/) deployment seems to be broken (Tuesday, 13 December 2022, 23:50 UTC).~~ The docs have been moved and are [now accessible](https://liberland-1.gitbook.io/wiki/v/public-documents/blockchain)

### Testing Guide Feedback

- ~~I didn't identify any automated tests in the [LLM pallet](https://github.com/liberland/liberland_substrate/blob/fdcc7b7e2bf27a82420487fcf264ad85a7f0952a/frame/llm/src/tests.rs)~~ Tests for the LLM pallet have been [added](https://github.com/liberland/liberland_substrate/blob/863e4d86cb027a999777f3948adf0abb59ae749a/frame/llm/src/tests.rs)
- Instructions for running the automated tests [have been added](https://github.com/liberland/liberland_substrate/tree/863e4d86cb027a999777f3948adf0abb59ae749a#run-automated-tests).
- ~~I tried running `cargo test` from the root directory but it failed:~~ Tests pass now:
