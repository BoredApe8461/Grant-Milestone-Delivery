## General Notes

1. In your documentation [here](https://liberland-1.gitbook.io/wiki/v/public-documents/blockchain/for-developers-and-testers/testing_guide), you are including link to google doc, instead of having the information available on the wiki. Consolidate your documentation in one place so you have one source of truth. 

2. In your Testing Guide, you are including some keys together with the mnemonics used to derive the keys. Make sure you keep all key information interally and preferably private, even if you are using for testing accounts. 

3. Docker image works. It seems we can run your node in --dev mode and from chain-spec. Maybe you can include this in your documentation.

###  Concluding Remarks

#### Remarks by @JosephKnecht-lab


Based on my evaluation, you have not provided all the deliverables as described in you application. Thus I have to reject this delivery. My advise is to update your initial application with the exact deliverables that you are delivering for this milestone, before it can be accepted. 

Furthermore, a lot of your pallets are derivative work from already existing pallets (such as registry, nfts) and I would expect more original work for grant submission. 

Note that this evaluation is not binding since I do not work of Web3 Foundation, so the Web3 team can accept your delivery in its current state.

I've added my remarks below in separate chapters:

## Testing Guide Feedback

- testing instructions can found in the [gitbook](https://liberland-1.gitbook.io/wiki/v/public-documents/blockchain/for-developers-and-testers/dev#run-automated-tests)
- ~~however, running the node failed with an "cannot deserialize module: UnknownOpcode(192)" error on my machine~~ the node can be run successfully:

## Landowner Pallet Feedback

Previous comment by @JosephKnecht-lab:

> Your pallet is almost exact fork from pallet-nfts. You have made small modificaiton to add citizenship information. In the original application you state you will use geo coordination but I don't see this reflected in code. Can you make the requirements for this pallet more explicit?

Final assessment by @takahser:

While there is no Landowner pallet, the functionality described in the grant proposal is covered by the NFT and Office pallets. In the previous version that @JosephKnecht-lab assessed, there was no on-chain validation logic for creating plots but this was fixed by a [follow-up PR](https://github.com/liberland/liberland_substrate/pull/291/files#diff-2126ae6766e9fabbb2462c7c1d2b0494c27b7c6e518f4672b1cc3a9d335afb3cR323). The validation takes care that plots are stored only if they're not self-intersecting, contain a minimum number of points (3), are correctly structured and are located within the allowed coordinates as configured (for the sake of this use case, the allowed coordinates equal the coordinates of Liberland). Personally, I agree with the approach to re-use the existing NFTs pallet rather than recreating the logic and adding the missing bits on top of it. This has been smoke-tested successfully.

## Metaverse Integration Pallet Feedback

Previous comment by @JosephKnecht-lab:

> Based on the submitted requirements in your application [document](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/liberland.md), you have not provided a pallet implementation. I understand that requirements can change during development, but these changes have to be reflected back in the original requirements document.

Final assessment by @takahser:

Similarly to the Landowner Pallet, while there is no pallet called "Metaverse Integration Pallet", the functionality the grantee promised in their proposal has actually been implemented. While the plotdata for the metaverse is stored on-chain in an efficient, encoded format, their centrally hosted middleware allows for easy decoding into a format that can be interpreted more easily by the metaverse. They also implemented an [on-chain role-based access model](https://github.com/liberland/liberland_substrate/blob/bc60180005a17a3953c95b96fb06b95fe539f6cb/bin/node/runtime/src/lib.rs#L300-L331). This has been smoke-tested successfully.
