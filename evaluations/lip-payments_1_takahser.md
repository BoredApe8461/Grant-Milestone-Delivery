## General Notes

### Documentation

- Instructions on how to run tests were added. To run them with benchmarks I used:

    ```bash
    make run # multi-node local testnet
    cargo build # update dependencies
    cargo test --features runtime-benchmarks
    ```

- Instructions on how to run benchmarks were added. I used:

    ```bash
    make benchmark pallet=virto-payment
    ```

    Results:

### Tests and benchmarks

  - benchmarks can now be executed together with the tests
  - the team followed [my feedback](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/338#issuecomment-1024143883) and added 8 additional tests to the original 10 tests it already had to cover all `PaymentHandler` methods
