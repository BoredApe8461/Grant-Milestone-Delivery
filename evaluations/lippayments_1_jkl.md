## General Notes

1. I like the fact that you have created benchmarks for your extrinsics. The reason for benchmarking is to analyse the weight off an extrinsic function. Meaning, when different parameters are inputted, we want to see how the computation inside the functions differs. For this reason, we benchmarking the extrinsic with varying inputs. In your benchmark, you are using many constants as inputs which defeats the purpose of benchmarking. 

2. I like that you are trying to simplify the build with a Makefile. Please try to document correctly the main MAKE commands for people in the ecosystem who want to use your work. 

3. I did commits on a new branch(evaluation) on your repo, but I don't have commit rights, so my commits were not accepted.

Accepted Note: Merge request was accepted and merged into master branch: https://github.com/virto-network/virto-node/pull/173

#### Documentation Feedback

Missing Readme Instructions on how to build node from source.

Please check the pull-request in your repo for updated documentation: https://github.com/virto-network/virto-node/pull/173
Please further improve...

Initially I ran cargo build --release but encountered this error.

```
Rust WASM toolchain not installed, please install it! Was fixed.

error: build failed
```

This was resolved once I ran make dev=yes and cargo build --release again.

Another issue that I encountered is that the executable in your readme is incorrect. virto_node executable is not created, but ./target/release/virto_parachain is created. Make sure you have correct documentation that reflects you build and code.


Please update documentation accordingly. 

```shell
./target/release/virto-parachain --help
```
instead of
```shell
./target/release/virto_node --help
```

Accepted Note: Documentation was added after initial review. https://github.com/virto-network/virto-node#build

#### Tests Feedback

Running tests locally gave me the following error.

This is because you are not including orml-tokens/std in your std output exclusion. I have added this via pull request to your repository: https://github.com/virto-network/virto-node/pull/173

After this fix, your tests were able to pass but your benchmarks failed:

Can you let me know why this is? I see that you can run benchmarks also through 
```shell
./target/release/virto-parachain benchmark
```
but benchmark should be able to run independently. 

Accepted Note: Running benchmark using Makefile was documented after initial review: https://github.com/virto-network/virto-node#benchmark
