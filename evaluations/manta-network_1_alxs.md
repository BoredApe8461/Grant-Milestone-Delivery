## General Notes

Team put a ton of effort in response to initial feedback. Clean code, well documented and good performance. All aspects of the delivery were improved, including overall code standards, functionality (hiding amounts in private transfers) and documentation.

See discussion on the [delivery PR](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/96).

Testing was also vastly expanded and a coverage report provided [here](https://github.com/Manta-Network/pallet-manta-dap#test-coverage).
