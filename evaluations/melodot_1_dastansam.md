# Evaluation v1

## General Notes

Well documented, good quality of code and good test coverage. The code is well commented and references are provided where needed. 

I saw that you included references to projects you took inspiration from, specifically `kzg` and `subspace`. It's good that you included `subspace` as they are working on something similar and I also noticed some similar patterns in the code. As long as the license is compatible, I think it's fine to do that, but it would be nice to explicitly mention what exactly was inspired or borrowed from `subspace` (like you already do with `kzg`), if there is anything, of course. Just adding `subspace` repository in references is a bit vague, I think.

# Evaluation v2

All the outsanding issues were resolved. Docker build now works and acknowledgements for external projects are more specific.
