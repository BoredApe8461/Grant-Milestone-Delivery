## General Notes

Summarizes the overall performance plus additional feedback/comments

### Documentation Feedback

- inline comments: very appropriate, not too many, not too few
- ~~there are 3 examples with run instructions, however, none of them compile:~~ the grantee fixed the examples that were broken due to a refactoring, they work now:

### Testing Feedback

- ~~it would be helpful if the tests followed the [AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/justmock/basic-usage/arrange-act-assert) pattern, especially since the code being tested is highly technical~~ fixed (and arguably, it was already partially used in the original codebase)
- test coverage: sufficient
- all tests succeed:

    ```bash
    % cargo test
        Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.21s
