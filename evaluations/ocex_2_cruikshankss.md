# Notes

### Important notes from their docs:

"a service for minting and validating coupons using 2 keys, one of which is known only to the buyer"

"our proposed app offers a fully decentralized service with a front-end communicating straight to the smart-contract with Polkadot.js and the centralized back-end will be used only for coupons generation and pushing them to the smart-contract, as well as for managing the service provider’s liquidity pool"

"we’ve made a docker set-up so you can build the smartcontract in a container, isolated from the main environment"

"Through a partnership with Kraken exchange and leading Slovenian companies – Petrol and Telekom Slovenije, Bitins became a widely used ramp to crypto that doesn’t include the need for a crypto-wallet or even a banking account."


"In this milestone we've developed a Centralized management back-end, that includes CLI tools for coupon lifecycle management and a user's basic web interface for coupons redemption."

### My notes 

Thanks for focusing on the ideal of democratization with a fiat on-ramp! They're so important!! Good luck with security along your business roadmap following this proof of concept grant! In my understanding this is a POC grant and grant funding does not include getting it fully production-ready of course. 

You said ~"coupons are technically utility tokens by definition". Thanks for idealizing this! Utility tokens by definition are useful, and have more of a Layer-0 security type of feel to me. If you consider doing Layer 0 security work for your project after this grant, please feel free to apply for more grants, treasury funding, etc., and feel free to email grants@web3.foundation or ashleyg@web3.foundation. :)

REALLY GREAT TESTING DEMO VIDEO! It helps me so much. Seriously, thanks.

Really nice terminal feedback / cli messages that helped me update the tool easily.

I think your UI is very aesthetic. Also, in general, great to see such a well-rounded team in UI/UX, front-end and substrate back-end!

Was so happy to see "found 0 vulnerabilities" -- SUPER CLEAN npm build! That's rare imho!

I think this is a very logical, practical and useful idea. Idealizes democratization. :) Well executed. Looking forward to the evolution of your project to reach as many ideals as you need/aspire to!

Really excellent article! Thanks for teaching the community how complicated wallet setup & security is while providing a solution.

Congratulations on your successful grant!!
