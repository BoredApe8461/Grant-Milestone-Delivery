## General Notes

Initially the UI was only for information purposes, which potentially was already sufficient to fulfil the contract. Nevertheless, they updated the UI to also allow delegation via the interfaces after I requested this feature. In general, they put a lot of effort into this and I'm more than happy to accept the milestone.
