## General Notes

Great delivery overall, though communication was at times patchy and the feedback provided wasn't always addressed.

Besides, as mentioned above tests were minimal and documentation could be greatly improved. The evaluation revealted plenty of bugs, many of which could most likely have been avoided with a comprehensive test suite.

Nevertheless, the team went over their delivery several times and did put some extra effort to address feedback.
