# General Notes

Very nicely made app. Works well and allows for quick generation and compliation/deployment of select PSP token standards using OpenBrush. They have a helpful Telegram support channel as well.

All issues in deployed app have been scheduled for a fix.

## Front-end

Docker fails when running `yarn build`:
```js
 => [3/4] RUN yarn install                                                                                          119.1s

```
The same happens when trying to run locally with yarn:
```js
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
`destination` does not start with `/`, `http://`, or `https://` for route {"source":"/api/:path*","destination":"undefined/:path*"}


Error: Invalid rewrite found
error Command failed with exit code 1.
```
UPDATE: Runs successfully after modifying the .env file:
```js
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Loaded env from /home/ubuntu/polkadot-contract-wizard/.env
event - compiled client and server successfully in 31.9s (14038 modules)

## Backend

The instructions for the [backend](https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard#backend) has a [broken link](https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/blob/develop/ink-compiler-be/README.md).

`docker-compose run compiler-be-test` runs successfully:
```js

```
All 33 Rust tests pass successfully. I can also build the release successfully and execute the API with `./target/release/compiler-be` once the Cargo env variable is set.
