## General Notes

They already started to work on the style guide	([Components design](https://www.figma.com/file/5NAICV06SHNbbIoYhrUS3u/PolkaDot?node-id=2781%3A0), [Navigation ver 1](https://www.figma.com/file/5NAICV06SHNbbIoYhrUS3u/PolkaDot?node-id=2782%3A0), [ver 2](https://www.figma.com/file/5NAICV06SHNbbIoYhrUS3u/PolkaDot?node-id=2782%3A1), [Updated fonts](https://www.figma.com/file/5NAICV06SHNbbIoYhrUS3u/PolkaDot?node-id=2268%3A9175)). Additionally, they keep maintaining the software. They haven't worked on "account list", "Update transfers" and "Documentation" so far, which were part of the original proposal. 

Therefore the contract was amended, see [#388](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/388). Now, everything is according to the deliverables and the milestone is accepted.
