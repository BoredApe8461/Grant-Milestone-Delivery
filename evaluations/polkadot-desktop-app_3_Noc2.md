## General Notes

Overall very good work, that shows that they actually tried to improve polkadot.js and did more than just trying to fulfill the contract. For a list of all PRs see the [delivery documentation](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/289). 

**Extra:**
- Proposed design for network multi-selection per account in extension and apps
