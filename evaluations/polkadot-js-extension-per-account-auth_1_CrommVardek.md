Ideally all links inside the above table should include the commit hash,
which was used for testing the delivery. It should also be checked if the software is published under the correct open-source license.

## General Notes

As I'm not familiar with polkadot-js extension's source code, it was not straight forward to link the changed files to a delivery step (as all delivery steps are linekd to the same PR).
It would have been nice to maybe link the corresponding commit(s) instead of the same PR. Hopefully the files changes are not huge so it is still comprehensive and not too difficult to navigate through. 

Missing article and documentation, not a big deal.
