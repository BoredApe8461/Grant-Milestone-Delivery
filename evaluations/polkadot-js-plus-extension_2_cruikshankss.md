# Additional Notes

I got all 19 test suites to pass locally by running:

```
git clone git@github.com:Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension.git
cd polkadot-Js-Plus-extension // master branch
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test:plus
```

I downloaded Mozilla and installed Plus from the [Firefox Add-Ons extension link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-plus-extension/). 

The app adheres to many ideals of a Progressive Web App (PWA). Plus is very helpful and has nice aesthetics in a cohesive style to the original extension. I learned a lot about Polkadot governance from using your extension.

Thank you very much for completing a grant with the Web3 Foundation! Congratulations on your invention.
