## General Notes

- Deployed at https://polkadot-contract-wizard.vercel.app/
- The code and repo are well-structured and documented. However, there are some minor issues that I must point out:
  - It should be mentioned in the documentation's [requirement](https://github.com/protofire/polkadot-contract-wizard/tree/milestone-1#b-local-stack) section that it's also required to run a local substrate node for the app to function properly.
  - The import paths should be fixed in the `utils.test.ts` and `formatting.test.ts`, otherwise the 2 of the tests are going to fail.
