## General Notes

I like the overall design as well as the offline smiley ;-). Everything works as intended (different languages, signatures, etc.). The only issue I noticed is that the app has no icon on ubuntu. Maybe some additional comments inside the code would be helpful (at least for the tutorial of milestone 3).
