## Comments

### Code structure

Initially the codebase was largely illegible due to formatting issues as well as code duplication.
This has been somewhat improved in subsequent version, although the application logic is still very repetitive. There is lots of data unpacking, perhaps more effort could be put into serialisation/deserialisation the data structures, and thus separating application logic from data handling.

### Testing

Initially no unit tests. The second iteration has tests, but it is virtually impossible they cover a good portion of the application logic, mainly due to the copupling of application logic & data handling/unpacking as mentioned above. 

Also all tests have hardcoded strings. Could be improved by either compising the test data from parts (e.g. Bob always has the same account address), or loading fixtures from a separate file? 

### UI

Again subjective, but the UI seems **still** very unintuitive, even after another rework from the team. There are **still** lots of fields without information on what these fields' function is, e.g.: "Master side royalty split", "Composition side royalty split" or "Other contracts royalty split". Some suggestions:
- tooltips for the fields
- default values where applicable?

I get warnings when I enter percentage values which are different from 100. In this case, if it's enforced to be 100, why do I have this field in the first place?

At the end I get the following info:
> Your form with contract id <ID> is submitted. If there's no error or the form is filled, We will send your info to our ipfs and node servers.

How am I supposed to know if it succeeded? How can I check the status of the contract, if there was no question about any contact details etc.?

Where is the data supposed to be stored, actually? Could you provide some helper commands for checking the data written to IPFS?

Also, how can I change which substrate chain I connect to? In the logs I see: `You are connected to chain Development using Substrate Node v0.0.1-248ae28-x86_64-linux-gnu` - but I would like to change this to my local version of the node that you ship with the `PolkaMusic-core` repo.

Update: somewhat improved, but again not really user-centric - there is a choice of two networks, both of which hardcoded. No way to input your own url in case you're not running it from `localhost:9944`.

Lastly, the error messages that pop up in the top right hand corner are very easy to miss, and not informative at all, e.g.:
"Missing mp3, artowkr, or csv files, save error".
