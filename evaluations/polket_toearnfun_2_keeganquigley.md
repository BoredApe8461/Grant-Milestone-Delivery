# General Notes

Branch is `milestone-02-delivery`.

I was able to operate the app both on a local node as well as the PNT testnet. I was able to complete all the modules in the test guide in order to:

1. Register and bind/unbind devices
2. Upload training reports
3. Charge "batteries"
4. Level up
5. Increase VFE ability
6. Transfer VFE/FUN
7. Make Order
8. Create and participate in buyback plan

**Polkadot-JS**

I was able to manually use all the functions on Polkadot.js as well.
