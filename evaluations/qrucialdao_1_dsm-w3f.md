## General Notes

## Update V4: December 2.

After a meeting with Six, the main flow of the application worked well. There are some extrinsics in alternative paths that need improvements that will be handled for the next delivery (challenge_report, game_result).

## Update V3: October 27.

I still having problems with docker. When I tried to build the image the step below failed:

```
Step 12/23 : ADD ./data /opt/data
ADD failed: file not found in build context or excluded by .dockerignore: stat data: file does not exist
```

The automated tests are now passing. 

Now it was provided a tutorial for testing the application. The steps of the tutorial provided worked. However, from the list of features of the software only two were effectively tested in the tutorial (sign_up and approve_auditor). Please, complete the tutorial in order to test all functions provided. The functions below are missing in the tutorial:

```
        pub fn tool_exec_req
        pub fn tool_exec_cancel_invalid
        pub fn tool_exec_auto_report
        pub fn challenge_report

        pub fn update_profile
        pub fn cancel_account
        pub fn game_result
```

## Update V2: October 6.

1. Problems with Docker
Commands. The build commands and folders are with some problems in the manual. The commands that worked for me were:

```
cd QRUCIAL-DAO/docker/files
docker build .  -t "qdao:V0.3"
```

  - dependencies
    - I needed to add `RUN apt-get install -y python3-setuptools` to line 11 of the docker file to fulfill a missing dependency problem.
  - expose ports
    - After the container start, there is no port exposed by the container. In this way, the services are not available outside of the container. Please export the ports needed to access the application from outside of the container.
  - service not running. After checking the services running inside the container the `tmux a -t qdao-api` was not running.


2. Clippy (ok)

- Ok. Most of the warnings were fixed.

3. Tests are not running. The pipeline in the repository is also showing that the tests are broken.

https://github.com/Qrucial/QRUCIAL-DAO/actions/runs/3161906474/jobs/5147991781

4. Docs

Ok. Improved.

5. Running the software.

I tried to guess some order and way to run the pallets extrinsic, however, when I started the auditor part I cannot get an authorized auditor.
Please, help me with a tutorial to run the full process of QDAO using the available methods. A complete example should be enough to fulfill this requirement of the evaluation.



----
## Evaluation V1

LICENSE – Ok.

Whitepaper and Wiki – Ok.

### Testing guide:

Please include these install requirements in the tutorial (without docker), I needed to install them to be able to install the QDAO:

```
sudo apt-get install tmux
cargo install keccak256-cli
```

After installing those dependencies I was able to run the system wihtout docker.

Using docker, I was able to build the container but when I ran it the following messages were presented and did not worked, please review:

```

```

Regarding the extrinsics/modules available for testing, would be nice to have more information to perform exploratory testing as a workflow (sequence of function calls that have a specific meaning), or use cases. Please provide the main flow of the application within an example, as a sequence of calls and expected results, for us to perform exploratory testing. If there are any alternative use cases (workflows) please also provide for testing. Maybe the wiki could be an appropriate location for this documentation.


### Automated Testing / Code Quality / Code documentation

 - exo_pallet/src/lib.rs – 60% - some methods are not covered, please improve.
 - audit_pallet/src/lib.rs – 75.32% - some error paths are not covered, and could be improved. Some unimplemented methods.
 - exosysd/src/main.rs – This code is quite complex, with many nested loops and conditionals. Could be refactored to have a better design.
