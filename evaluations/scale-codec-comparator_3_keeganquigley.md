# General Notes

Relatively straight forward delivery adding Dependabot to bump updates for maintenance and testing with GitHub actions.

[Dependabot](https://github.com/gmajor-encrypt/scale-codec-comparator/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml) .yml file works. Looks like latest couple bumps from the Dependabot [failed](https://github.com/gmajor-encrypt/scale-codec-comparator/actions/runs/3982725063/jobs/6827425214)?

**UPDATE:** Github action issues were resolved. It is now working as expected.
