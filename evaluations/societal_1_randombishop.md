## General Notes

The milestone works as expected.

At this point, it is an adaptation of 
substrate pallets `frame/collective`, `frame/treasury` and `frame/membership` 
with data stored per DAO instead of a single one.



## Improvement suggestions:

- Add some context and explanations to the testing guide to make each step easier to understand. 
Like what is actually happening under the hood at each step.

- For next milestone, please include an end-user-facing article that 
shows how to use the features of Societal and clarifies the expectations of each function.
