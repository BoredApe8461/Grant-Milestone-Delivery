# General Notes

Relatively straight forward maintanance delivery. PRs checked and look good. I was able to install Solang and compile example contracts to upload in Polkadot-JS. The software works well. Thanks for your hard work on keeping all the docs up to date. 

I was able to run Solang locally as well as in the Solang container. I also played around with using the [usage](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#compiler-usage) tags and the documentation generation tool is pretty cool too.
## Tests

All unit tests pass except for one:
```rust
test eth_builtins ... ok
test selfdestruct ... ok
test address ... ok
test try_catch ... ok
test ethereum_solidity_tests ... FAILED

failures:

```
I wonder if it's possibly panicking because I don't have necessary Ethereum dependencies on my machine. This test isn't part of this milestone, but consider looking into it. 

`cargo clippy` returns null.
