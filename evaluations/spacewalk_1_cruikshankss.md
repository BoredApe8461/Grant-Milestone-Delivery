## Additional Notes

Dear Pendulum/Spacewalk team,

Congratulations and very nice job implementing that complicated bridge protocol. You seem to be very strong in the web3 fundamentals and we are thankful to have your team in the ecosystem. Please also consider implementing XCMP if that makes sense for your project. Feel free to apply for an amendment for your business plan now that you have a better estimate of the workload. Wishing you continued success with milestones 2 and 3! If you would like to discuss anything technically, such as wasm smart contracts, xcm, xcmp, hrmp, etc., my inbox is open ashleyg@web3.foundation.

Kind regards,
Ashley Grevelink
