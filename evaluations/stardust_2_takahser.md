## General Notes

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the recent collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem. It covers the history of thereof, including the preceding algorithmic stablecoin "Basis Cash" which was launched by Terraform Labs' Do Kwon and eventually failed as well. Furthermore, it provides insights into the rise and fall of the ecosystem while explaining the alleged mistakes that were made and led to Terra/Luna's collapse. Finally, it concludes that no malicious actors were identified that attacked the vulnerable mechanisms to lead to the collapse, instead the authors believe it rather failed organically, due to a combination of challenging market circumstances (FED rate hikes) and flawed game-theoretical incentives.
