## General Notes

Installing with `cargo install subalfred` fails with

```
error: could not find `subalfred` in registry `crates-io` with version `*`
```
which is probably due to no non-RC version having been released yet.

Unclear how the `track-updates` command "lists the companions that you need to do from substrate/cumulus/frontier/parity-bridges-substrate" as described in the application.

Documentation is very sparse, for example in the case of the `workspace` command only the tool's CLI help is replicaded in the user guide.
Mismatched section [headers](https://subalfred.hack.ink/user/cli/workspace.html#command-workspace-update-1), no explanation of what the different options are (what options can I provide to the `--targets` flag) or the concepts used in the tool (what exactly is a workspace? what are workspace "members"?).

### General Notes v2

`cargo install subalfred` still fails, but the team noted that they will fix the rc version for the next milestone.

I am able to use Subalfred and run commands such as `subalfred check` and `subalfred features`. Very useful tool! Some docs were updated. I agree with my colleague that the documentation could improve. The "episodes" help, but it would be nice to see an introductory paragraph as well for each page. 

**Tests**

One unit test still fails due to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable:

Team has addressed this [here](https://subalfred.hack.ink/user/cli/track-updates.html#example). Omitting the token works for now as a workaround.
