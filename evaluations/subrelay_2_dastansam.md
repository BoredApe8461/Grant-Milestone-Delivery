## General Notes

In general, all the features are delivered, I was able to test them on production and everything works as expected. 

The only thing that I couldn't test locally was the integration tests. Initially the errors were related to Postgres DB, I resolved them and even run the `migration` script that you run in the CI `yarn run typeorm migration:run`. But I still get several errors and all tests are failing. Maybe this is related to my local environment, regardless, I think this part of the code is missing some documentation. I see that errors are related to DB and missing tokens for Discord and Telegram bots. Would be great if you could clearly indicate pre-requisites for running the integration tests locally in the README.

A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.
