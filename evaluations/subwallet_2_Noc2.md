## General Notes

All issues were fixed quickly and everything works now. However, no support for Kusama or an option to delete accounts, which would have been nice since transfers on Polkadot are not yet enabled. If I back-up my wallet, it doesnâ€™t ask me to confirm my password, which would be very useful. Also, the code isn't very well documented or structured and has some unused variables. So, it might be a little bit more difficult for others to actually use the CLI wallet for their own projects.
