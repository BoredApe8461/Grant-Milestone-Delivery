**General Notes**

## Evaluation V2

The author [justified](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/689#issuecomment-1405315863) why he didn't conduct more interviews, the reasons are ok in my opinion. Doing more interviews possibly would not add more content to the article. 

My questions and requests were all fulfilled, including the publishing of [the preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11074).


## Evaluation V1

Iterviews:

In the requirement, you say: "The SydTek team will interview members of Phala Network, RMRK and Parity Technologies to identify ways users can leverage SBTs and the Social Recovery pallet within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems for digital inheritance.".

The first interview is with Joshua Waller from Phala Network, a member of the SydTek team, as reported in your application: https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/SydTek.md. I found the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgW1Dc-zBMY.


The second interview is with Tyler Doussan from Safe Heaven. I was not able to find your interview with him. However, I notice in the transcript some copy-and-paste transcripts from podcasts and youtube channels. Could you explain that?

Starting from line 389 the transcript was extracted from this podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/safe-haven-pioneering-decentralized-digital-inheritance/id1593028990?i=1000565482923


Starting from line 490 of the transcript, they were extracted from this youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oenymBrwfLw).


There are also transcripts from this video Substrate Social Recovery Pallet Code Walkthrough with Joe Petrowski and Shawn Tabrizi (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRnWKDaTb9E).


Could you provide explanations on why did you copy and pasted transcripts of youtube videos on a deliverable that should be interviews conducted by SydTek with Phala Network, RMRK and Parity Technologies members?

The paper is well-written and easy to understand. Some small requests here:

1. In the section THE SOCIAL RECOVERY PALLET, Fig 1 is not available in the text. Please include the image in the deliverable.
2. In the section EXECUTING THE DIGITAL INHERITANCE PROCESS ON POLKADOT AND KUSAMA, the schema described starts with "the digital executor could submit a deposit to initiate the social recovery". My question is, how the digital executor will know that he/she needs to start social recovery?
3. In the section ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, it must include a notice that the paper was supported by the web3 foundation, as discussed in the application. 
4. We expect for the paper delivery that a PDF should be provided and a preprint should be registered in some archive (ex. [arvix](https://arxiv.org/)). This could be performed in the next milestone if it is more convenient for you.
