The process consisted of five stages: preparation, retrieval, screening, selection, and write-up. Filters like language, journal type, and subject area were applied. They were ranked by journal impact factor. It's described how the results can be reproduced.  |

Ideally all links inside the above table should include the commit hash,
which was used for testing the delivery. It should also be checked if the software is published under the correct open-source license.

## General Notes

- in general, there a quite some typos in the paper, see also [Polkadot Parachains Section Feedback](#polkadot-parachains-section-feedback)
- 3 Notation is currently an empty chapter

### Polkadot Parachains Section Feedback

- in my personal opinion this chapter could use some more counter-checking as there are some typos and sentences that don't make sense, for example:
    - "Initial proposal flow-chart/decision-tree development that will help developers place their
token in the following contexts." => this seems incomplete
    - "Types under the following topics" => I think there should be a colon after it
    - "Parachain" => Parachains
    - "slow to emerge," => there is a verb missing
  - Note that these are just some examples in the first 2 paragraphs, it's not a complete list.
- Nevertheless, I'm willing to accept this delivery since the chapter is still WIP and will be updated later. However, it's important to note that for finalized chapters, higher standards will apply during the evaluation process for future deliveries.
