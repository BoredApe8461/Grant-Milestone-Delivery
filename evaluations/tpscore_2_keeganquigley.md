# General Notes

App works nicely and good documentation. I'm able to create the Docker networks and connect `db_mysql`, `airflow_scheduler`, and `tpscore-web-client`. All of the instructions work as expected.

I'm not sure what these indicators are supposed to mean exactly. Also, how often do these feeds get updated? I see the latest published ones are from August 9th.
