**Additional Information**

This was implemented slightly different from the original proposal. However, the end goal functionality is the same.  I plan to amend the original proposal in due time as this milestone pans out. 

**UPDATE:** The [amendment PR](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1202) was submitted and merged.

# General Notes

Nice app! I can already see the PoC coming together here. Great delivery overall, and I think that p2p messaging systems like this are very necessary. I can't wait to see what the front end looks like. 

## Documentation & Testing

Great documentation and code comments. You might consider adding some scenario examples as well. Manually testing worked for all modules, as well as producing errors. I could successfully query the chain state with `activeConversations`, `conversations()`, `isActiveConversation()`, `palletVersion()`, `usernames()`.

**Uke Pallet - Conversation Storage**

I'm able to successfully use `storeMessage(message, time, convoId, recipient)` to store a message and create a conversation. I can also create new conversations, manage them, mark them as active, and add new messages.

**Uke Pallet - Basic Identiy Scheme**

I'm able to successfully `register` a username to an `AccountId` and query it from chain state. Correctly maps active convos to `StorageMap` for both participants.

`cargo clippy` originally generated 13 warnings about redundant clones, but they have been fixed.

**Please Note:** No security audit(s) have been conducted as a part of this evaluation.
