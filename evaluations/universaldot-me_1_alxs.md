## General Notes

The 3 simple pallets are thoroughly documented and the code is clean and well-presented.
Weight estimates as promised in the additional information of the application can be found in the node repository.

---

Only a few minor issues were found:
- The testnet WebSocket doesn't work with the live version of polkadot.{js} apps due to a security error:

- Docker instructions in the node repository don't work.
- `cargo clippy` reports a number of warnings in `pallet-dao` and `pallet-task` (addressed)
- The deliveries in the node repository are currently split among 3 different branches. `master` contains the updated README, `add_pallets` the working version of the node with the pallets and `add_weights` the benchmark-generated weights. (addressed)
