## General Notes
- **26.06.23** : 
  
  - The main delta of M2 compared to M1 seemed to be 1) implementation of a substrate module for importing witnessed events and 2) devising a practical benchmark/application sample.
  - As stated by the grantee, quantitative reporting of the TPS benchmark is still pending. However, considering that the assessment of performance is context-dependent and there are no specific hard requirements for evaluation, I consider the current contribution acceptable.
