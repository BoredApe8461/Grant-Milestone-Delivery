`yarn test` also doesn't work to run any tests. I'm not seeing a tests folder or any unit tests.

2. `yarn test` succeeds, but Jest doesn't exit because of operations that are still active:
```js

Ran all test suites matching /src\/substrate\/polkadot.test.js/i.
Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.

When running `yarn test --detectOpenHandles` it shows that there is an issue with the API promises:

## V2 

**UPDATE: Tests have been resolved. Code comments have been somewhat improved. 

I would also recommend adding functionality for Westend (testnet) so that users (as well as yourself) can use it for testing purposes.

ESlint: Still a lot of unused variables and assigned declarations that are never used. This dead code could bloat software performance and possibly even effect security; I would recommend cleaning up the code more.

PLEASE NOTE: No security audits were performed as a part of this evaluation.
