What you are currently doing is manually testing the functionality. See point 3 in General Notes for more details.|

The only thing that perhaps can be improved is the large size of the docker image. This could be improved by using a different base image perhaps.|

| 2. | UI Module:fully-automatic chart generation|<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [link](https://dev-v2.web3go.xyz) | It works. See point 6 below. |


## General Notes

1. You are exposing database passwords in plain text here: https://github.com/web3go-xyz/web3go-xyz-v2/blob/develop/v2-mvp/api-service-extend/ecosystem.config.js. Please consider using [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to hide infromation that should not be publicly available.
2. Many of your npm packages have variabilities that could be resolved. See below.

```
25 vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 18 high, 3 critical)

To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix

To address all issues possible (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Some issues need review, and may require choosing
a different dependency.
```
1.  You are not using automated tests in your code. Consider improving on this. What you are doing is manual tests. In the original application, you are not stating if the tests should be made automated or manual, so I will accept the delivery from my side.  In the future, consider using automated testing tools such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). If you are not familiar with automated tests, please read this [article](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/manual-vs-automated-testing-differences) that goes over the benefits of automated testing. Your current testing guide explains how to run a single e2e test, that can be automated.

4. Docker image does not work on Mac M1 architecture.
```

5. The integration with PolkdotJS wallet works smoothly. Good job. 

6. I was able to generate a nice graph for fees.
