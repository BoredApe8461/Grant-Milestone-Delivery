| 0c. | Testing Guide |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>|https://web3go.notion.site/Run-Local-Environment-By-Docker-Image-5426f050eb534b8f97318ba1b089e5b2| Testing guide usually refers to a guide on how to run unit/e2e tests. What you are currently doing is manually testing the functionality. See point 3 in General Notes for more details.|
| 0d. | Docker |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>|https://hub.docker.com/layers/web3go/web3go/v2-alpha-0.3/images/sha256-b16a63f497936cf17a8d3f6ab5a6200854f5be957720715e82052b56c936ba99?context=explore| Good. The only thing that perhaps can be improved is the large size of the docker image (1.67GB). This could be improved by using a different base image perhaps.|

| 1. | UI Module:support more charts in semi-automatic chart generation |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>|https://dev-v2.web3go.xyz| Good. However, there can be many configurable options to graphs so perhaps the generation of these charts should be made more intuitive.|  
| 2. | UI Module:fully-automatic chart generation|<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>|https://dev-v2.web3go.xyz| It works. See point 6 below. |


## General Notes

1. You are exposing database passwords in plain text here: https://github.com/web3go-xyz/web3go-xyz-v2/blob/develop/v2-mvp/api-service-extend/ecosystem.config.js. Please consider using [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to hide infromation that should not be publicly available.
2. Many of your npm packages have variabilities that could be resolved. See below.

```
25 vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 18 high, 3 critical)

To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix

To address all issues possible (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Some issues need review, and may require choosing
a different dependency.
```
3.  You are not using automated tests in your code. Consider improving on this:
```
No tests found, exiting with code 1
Run with `--passWithNoTests` to exit with code 0
In web3go-xyz-v2/v2-mvp/api-service-extend/src
  299 files checked.
  testMatch:  - 0 matches
  testPathIgnorePatterns: /node_modules/ - 299 matches
  testRegex: .*\.spec\.ts$ - 0 matches
Pattern:  - 0 matches
```
4. Docker image does not work on Mac M1 architecture.
```
api-service-extend % docker run -d -p 20080:80 --name web3go-v2-alpha-0.3 web3go/web3go:v2-alpha-0.3
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

But works on Ubuntu 20.04

5. The integration with PolkdotJS wallet works smoothly. Good job. 

6. I was able to generate a nice graph for fees.
