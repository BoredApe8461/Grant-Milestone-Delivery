## General Notes

### PSP-33 

The discussions were held in private. No problem since the process currently allows it, but in the future probably this discussions will need to be held in public. 

### Documentation

The coverage of the tutorial was improved. 

## Evaluation V1

### PSP-33 

The [PSP-33](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/blob/master/PSPs/psp-33.md) is in Published status. Just one doubt, the [PSP process](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs) considers the PSP starts in the draft, then goes for at least 2 weeks to Call for Feedback stage and then to Published. Were those steps followed? I cannot find records on the repository from the draft and call for feedback stages. 

### Documentation

Tutorial in the format of tests is some way difficult to read. Would be nice to have at least some text to explain or link the parts of the PSP-33 with the related tests, which are examples of it. 

Furthermore, as the tutorial is in the format of tests, I measured the testing coverage of it and some parts are not covered. There is some reason for that? What are the implications of having parts of PSP-33 not covered by the tutorial at this stage?
