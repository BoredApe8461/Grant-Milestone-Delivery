**General Notes**

## Evaluation V4

After setting up the Zombienet provided, the example of the script src/examples/local-network/reserveAssets-statemine-to-trappist.ts worked doing a limitedReserveTransferAssets operation.


## Evaluation V3

I minted a new asset (Id: 1985) tried the XCM asset transaction and didn't worked: tx: 0x39ed3b0ae3e9d79e47265e257dba8e7e19c5eef4d5a60492d92e10fd20bd6026

Result:


![screen-failing-xcm-asset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112647953/212341567-068af424-e367-434b-b5c4-be0ec9f31b52.jpg)

There is anything else that I should do to this transaction work?

All other transactions worked. 

## Evaluation V2

The warnings in the unit tests and from ESLint were solved. 

Regarding the system tests: 

* Only the limited version of the methods were used in the system tests. Please include system tests for the other functions available.

- rococo-to-rockmine - worked, the assets were transfered. tx: 0x7aac9818bc7ce4f91a94ac4ca48798b68450a7a45d3693c45c6b401f917ace39
- rococo-to-dali - the XCM msg was sent but the asset was not transfered. Please explain. tx: 0xf73f0408b2a5fd5f060a01a22eef6ce96dd4cac3cc448f62c8b3e29893cc6e45
- rockmine-to-rococo - worked, the assets were transfered. tx: 0x44ccd0a55079683146b5fb9c32e891346824d410f44b899333a01d27b29dc750
- rockmine-to-dali-roc.ts - the XCM msg was sent but the asset was not transfered. Please explain. tx: 0x41a008489fce5bcb43c33be579481ffb36f328f4b61b989bee23058958f87550
- rockmine-to-dali-asset.ts - the XCM msg was sent but the asset was not transfered. Please explain. tx: 0x8d15e12be2cc7fbfdfb42aa5584555871f40a0ae0c7dfa198a73f943582d6dc2

The XCM transactions which uses limitedReserveTransferAssets function are returning FailedToTransactAsset as showed below:

## Evaluation V1

### Testing

The tests are running and passing with good coverage. However, there is a msg of a connection failure in almost all test cases. This could indicate that the transactions are not being executed since there is no local blockchain running. Please provide explanations on this msg and better instructions on the setup environment needed to run the automated tests.

### System tests

 I saw that there are instructions for running some transactions in Rococo, however, when I tried to execute some examples it fail. See the prints below. Please provide one or more scripts for system testing. The examples in the SDK are good for the developers but for system testing purposes I shouldn't do the programming of the examples. 

Code:

```
import { web3FromAddress, web3Accounts, web3Enable } from "@polkadot/extension-dapp";
import { Provider } from "xcm-sdk";

const fun = async () =>{
  const extensions = await web3Enable("my cool dapp");
  const accounts = await web3Accounts();
  console.log(accounts);  
  const accountId = accounts[0].address;

  const injector = await web3FromAddress(accountId);

  const provider = new Provider("wss://rococo-rpc.polkadot.io", accountId);
  console.log(provider);
  provider.setInjectorSigner(injector.signer);

  const destination = "Parachain"
  const destinationValue = 2000 // Rockmine parchain id
  const beneficiary = "AccountId32"
  const beneficiaryValue = "GbxefAnqRioX195Vc5jApLdUi8qc2D7A6FNzLPe2JmVLVRm" // account address
  const amount = 1000000000000000

  const res = await provider.limitedTeleportAssets({
  destination,
  destinationValue,
  beneficiary,
  beneficiaryValue,
  amount,
  });

  console.log(res);
}

fun();
```
