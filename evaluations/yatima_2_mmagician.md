### General notes

After diffing the relevant files against the repo they were forked from (& a specific tag for [conslist](https://github.com/bodil/im-rs/blob/10.2.0/src/conslist.rs)), I started to doubt the depth of the integration done for substrate compatibility, despite seemingly long commit history and numerous structural changes.

Specifically, the changes introduced are limited to:
- formatting fixes
- inclusion of the quickcheck mod for testing (covered by deliverable 0c.)
- file re-structure (e.g. [`src/vector`](https://github.com/yatima-inc/sp-im/blob/main/src/vector.rs) is just the [`mod.rs`](https://github.com/bodil/im-rs/blob/master/src/vector/mod.rs), reformatted)
- changes to docs
- replacing `std` with `sp_std`
- removing some lib components

See for example the attached diff of `conslist.rs` by running: `git checkout 10.2.0; git diff -w src/conslist.rs ../sp-im/src/conslist.rs` from within the [`im-rs`](https://github.com/bodil/im-rs/) repo: [diff](./support_docs/yatima_2_conslist.diff).

Nevertheless, I am accepting this milestone as it's mostly consistent with the discussion under [the original application PR](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/463#discussion_r660176761), although perhaps the deliverables should be more explicitly stated next time around for clarity.
