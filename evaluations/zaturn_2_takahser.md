## General Notes

Summarizes the overall performance plus additional feedback/comments

### Documentation Feedback

- The [README](https://github.com/Acurast/data-processor/blob/228cd3204c9903b87e9e6faad3249e1870e47719/README.md) is sparse but contains the most basic instructions required to build, test and use the android-based processor app

- ~~Inline comments within the Kotlin files are currently almost non-existent. I understand that clean code can document itself to a certain extent, but I think it would be helpful to add some basic inline comments to the core logic at least.~~ => Inline comments have [been added](https://github.com/Acurast/data-processor/commit/ef39a4d061831862ffe53aafb6a0805f9be47a44)

- ~~Android APK can be built successfully, however, there are quite a few warnings~~ => fixed

    ```bash
    data-processor % ./gradlew assemble 
    
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
    160 actionable tasks: 2 executed, 158 up-to-date
    ```

### Tests Feedback

- All the functionality was successfully smoke-tested

- ~~Currently, there are very few tests available: 3 within `BlockchainTest.kt` and 8 within `EncodingTest.kt`~~ 

- According to the spec, the core logic should be completely covered by tests. Examples of core logic that is currently not covered by automated tests include, but are not limited to:

    - `V8Executor.kt` => tests added 
    - `Acurast.kt` => tests added (AcurastTest.kt)
    - `App.kt` => tests added
    - `IPFS.kt` => tests added (IPFSTest.kt)
    - `Package.kt` => tests won't be added, because manual interaction is required
    - `Lockdown.kt` => tests won't be added, because manual interaction is required

- The tests pass but it would be nice if the output was more detailed (e.g. showing, which tests were run):

    ```bash
    % ./gradlew test

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
    89 actionable tasks: 89 up-to-date   
    ```
