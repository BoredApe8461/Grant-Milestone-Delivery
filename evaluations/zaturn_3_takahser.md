Ideally all links inside the above table should include the commit hash,
which was used for testing the delivery. It should also be checked if the software is published under the correct open-source license.

## General Notes

Summarizes the overall performance plus additional feedback/comments

### Documentation Feedback

As this milestone involves work in multiple repositories, I'm going to provide my feedback seperately for each of them.

- [x] [data-processor repo](https://github.com/Acurast/data-processor): See M2 evaluation
- [x] [acurast-docs](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-docs)
- [x] [acurast-substrate](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-substrate/tree/develop): ~~There are a lot of functions that have no explanatory inline comments, for example [here](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-substrate/blob/7eed45b5a9b90d32a76e1702501bd00570177417/runtime/src/lib.rs#L343-L1009), [here](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-substrate/blob/7eed45b5a9b90d32a76e1702501bd00570177417/runtime/src/xcm_adapters.rs#L33-L99), [here](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-substrate/blob/7eed45b5a9b90d32a76e1702501bd00570177417/node/src/chain_spec.rs#L316-L327) or [here](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-substrate/blob/7eed45b5a9b90d32a76e1702501bd00570177417/node/src/command.rs#L316-L450)~~ -> inline comments have been added
- [x] ~~[acurast-core](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core): similarly to the acurast-substrate repo, I think more inline comments would make the code easier to understand for other devs. For some examples, see [here](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core/blob/130e3abfbb6a1c4ef85c595e72c5ff00f6c7d444/pallets/acurast/src/lib.rs#L294-L317) or [here](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core/blob/130e3abfbb6a1c4ef85c595e72c5ff00f6c7d444/pallets/acurast/p384/ecdsa/src/lib.rs#L233-L404). Please note that this is not a complete list.~~ -> inline comments have been added
