**Context**

This month we helped the Substrate developers understand how changes to Binaryen
111's use of WebAssembly features impact their project; made significant
progress towards making unicode paths work on Windows; and fixed some minor bugs
in the wasm-opt-rs bindings.

There were no new releases of Binaryen this month,
so no work on upgrading wasm-opt-rs.
Next month we expect to complete the work on unicode paths on Windows,
and after that there is no significant maintenance work on the horizon
except for making upgrades for Binaryen releases.

**Deliverables**

Note: a full hourly accounting of work performed is included with the invoice.
