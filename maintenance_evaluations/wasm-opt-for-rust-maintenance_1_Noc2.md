## General Notes

Besides the links above, the minor issues collected in milestone "M3" can be tracked here: https://github.com/brson/wasm-opt-rs/milestone/2?closed=1. The overall work is according to the contract, and the number of hours invoice seems reasonable. It is nice that the PRs are immediately opened at the parity repos.
